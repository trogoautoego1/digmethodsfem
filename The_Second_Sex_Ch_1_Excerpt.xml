WOMAN? Very simple, say the fanciers of simple formulas: she is a womb, an ovary; she is a
female – this word is sufficient to define her. In the mouth of a man the epithet female has
the sound of an insult, yet he is not ashamed of his animal nature; on the contrary, he is
proud if someone says of him: ‘He is a male!’ The term ‘female’ is derogatory not because it
emphasises woman’s animality, but because it imprisons her in her sex; and if this sex 
seems to man to be contemptible and inimical even in harmless dumb animals, it is 
evidently because of the uneasy hostility stirred up in him by woman. Nevertheless he 
wishes to find in biology a justification for this sentiment. The word female brings up in his 
mind a saraband of imagery – a vast, round ovum engulfs and castrates the agile 
spermatozoan; the monstrous and swollen termite queen rules over the enslaved males; the 
female praying mantis and the spider, satiated with love, crush and devour their partners; 
the bitch in heat runs through the alleys, trailing behind her a wake of depraved odours; the 
she-monkey presents posterior immodestly and then steals away with hypocritical 
coquetry; and the most superb wild beasts – the tigress, the lioness, the panther – bed down 
slavishly under the imperial embrace of the male. Females sluggish, eager, artful, stupid, 
callous, lustful, ferocious, abased – man projects them all at once upon woman. And the 
fact is that she is a female. But if we are willing to stop thinking in platitudes, two questions 
are immediately posed: what does the female denote in the animal kingdom? And what 
particular kind of female is manifest in woman?

Males and females are two types of individuals which are differentiated within a species for 
the function of reproduction; they can be defined only correlatively. But first it must be noted 
that even the division of a species into two sexes is not always clear-cut.

In nature it is not universally manifested. To speak only of animals, it is well known that 
among the microscopic one-celled forms – infusoria, amoebae, sporozoans, and the like – 
multiplication is fundamentally distinct from sexuality. Each cell divides and subdivides by 
itself. In many-celled animals or metazoans reproduction may take place asexually, either 
by schizogenesis – that is, by fission or cutting into two or more parts which become new 
individuals – or by blastogenesis – that is, by buds that separate and form new individuals. 
The phenomena of budding observed in the fresh-water hydra and other coelenterates, in 
sponges, worms, and tunicates, are well-known examples. In cases of parthenogenesis the 
egg of the virgin female develops into an embryo without fertilisation by the male, which thus 
may play no role at all. In the honey-bee copulation takes place, but the eggs may or may not 
be fertilised at the time of laying. The unfertilised eggs undergo development and produce 
the drones (males); in the aphids males are absent during a series of generations in which 
the eggs are unfertilised and produce females. Parthenogenesis has been induced artificially 
in the sea urchin, the starfish, the frog, and other species. Among the one-celled animals 
(Protozoa), however, two cells may fuse, forming what is called a zygote; and in the honey-
bee fertilisation is necessary if the eggs are to produce females. In the aphids both males 
and females appear in the autumn, and the fertilised eggs then produced are adapted for 
over-wintering.

Certain biologists in the past concluded from these facts that even in species capable of 
asexual propagation occasional fertilisation is necessary to renew the vigour of the race – to 
accomplish ‘rejuvenation’ through the mixing of hereditary material from two individuals. On 
this hypothesis sexuality might well appear to be an indispensable function in the most 
complex forms of life; only the lower organisms could multiply without sexuality, and even 
here vitality would after a time become exhausted. But today this hypothesis is largely 
abandoned; research has proved that under suitable conditions asexual multiplication can 
go on indefinitely without noticeable degeneration, a fact that is especially striking in the 
bacteria and Protozoa. More and more numerous and daring experiments in 
parthenogenesis are being performed, and in many species the male appears to be 
fundamentally unnecessary. Besides, if the value of intercellular exchange were 
demonstrated, that value would seem to stand as a sheer, unexplained fact. Biology 
certainly demonstrates the existence of sexual differentiation, but from the point of view of 
any end to be attained the science could not infer such differentiation from the structure of 
the cell, nor from the laws of cellular multiplication, nor from any basic phenomenon.

The production of two types of gametes, the sperm and the egg, does not necessarily imply 
the existence of two distinct sexes; as a matter of fact, egg and sperm – two highly 
differentiated types of reproductive cells – may both be produced by the same individual. 
This occurs in normally hermaphroditic species, which are common among plants and are 
also to be found among the lower animals, such as annelid worms and molluscs. In them 
reproduction may be accomplished through self-fertilisation or, more commonly, cross-
fertilisation. Here again certain biologists have attempted to account for the existing state of 
affairs. Some hold that the separation of the gonads (ovaries and testes) in two distinct 
individuals represents an evolutionary advance over hermaphroditism; others on the 
contrary regard the separate condition as primitive, and believe that hermaphroditism 
represents a degenerate state. These notions regarding the superiority of one system or the 
other imply the most debatable evolutionary theorising. All that we can say for sure is that 
these two modes of reproduction coexist in nature, that they both succeed in accomplishing 
the survival of the species concerned, and that the differentiation of the gametes, like that 
of the organisms producing them, appears to be accidental. It would seem, then, that the 
division of a species into male and female individuals is simply an irreducible fact of 
observation.

In most philosophies this fact has been taken for granted without pretence of explanation. 
According to the Platonic myth, there were at the beginning men, women, and 
hermaphrodites. Each individual had two faces, four arms, four legs, and two conjoined 
bodies. At a certain time they were split in two, and ever since each half seeks to rejoin its 
corresponding half. Later the gods decreed that new human beings should be created 
through the coupling of dissimilar halves. But it is only love that this story is intended to 
explain; division into sexes is assumed at the outset. Nor does Aristotle explain this division, 
for if matter and form must cooperate in all action, there is no necessity for the active and 
passive principles to he separated in two different categories of individuals. Thus St Thomas 
proclaims woman an ‘incidental’ being, which is a way of suggesting – from the male point 
of view – the accidental or contingent nature of sexuality. Hegel, however, would have been 
untrue to his passion for rationalism had he failed to attempt a logical explanation. Sexuality 
in his view represents the medium through which the subject attains a concrete sense of 
belonging to a particular kind (genre). ‘The sense of kind is produced in the subject as an 
effect which offsets this disproportionate sense of his individual reality, as a desire to find 
the sense of himself in another individual of his species through union with this other, 
to complete himself and thus to incorporate the kind (genre) within his own nature and bring 

it into existence. This is copulation’ (Philosophy of Nature, Part 3, Section 369). And a little 
farther on. ‘The process consists in this, namely: that which they are in themselves, that is 
to say a single kind, one and the same subjective life, they also establish it as such.’ And 
Hegel states later that for the uniting process to be accomplished, there must first be sexual 
differentiation. But his exposition is not convincing: one feels in it all too distinctly the 
predetermination to find in every operation the three terms of the syllogism.

The projection or transcendence of the individual towards the species, in which both 
individual and species are fulfilled, could be accomplished without the intervention of a third 
element in the simple relation of progenitor to offspring; that is to say, reproduction could be 
asexual. Or, if there were to be two progenitors, they could be similar (as happens in 
hermaphroditic species) and differentiated only as particular individuals of a single type. 
Hegel’s discussion reveals a most important significance of sexuality, but his mistake is 
always to argue from significance to necessity, to equate significance with necessity. Man 
gives significance to the sexes and their relations through sexual activity, just as he gives 
sense and value to all the functions that he exercises; but sexual activity is not necessarily 
implied in the nature of the human being. Merleau-Ponty notes in the Phénoménologie de la 
perception that human existence requires us to revise our ideas of necessity and 
contingence. ‘Existence,’ he says, ‘has no casual, fortuitous qualities, no content that does 
not contribute to the formation of its aspect; it does not admit the notion of sheer fact, for it 
is only through existence that the facts are manifested.’ True enough. But it is also true that 
there are conditions without which the very fact of existence itself would seem to be 
impossible. To be present in the world implies strictly that there exists a body which is at 
once a material thing in the world and a point of view towards this world; but nothing requires 
that this body have this or that particular structure. Sartre discusses in L’Étre et le 
néant Heidegger’s dictum to the effect that the real nature of man is bound up with death 
because of man’s finite state. He shows that an existence which is finite and yet unlimited in 
time is conceivable; but none the less if death were not resident in human life, the relation 
of man to the world and to himself would be profoundly disarranged – so much so that the 
statement ‘Man is mortal’ would be seen to have significance quite other than that of a mere 
fact of observation. Were he immortal, an existent would no longer be what we call a man. 
One of the essential features of his career is that the progress of his life through time creates 
behind him and before him the infinite past and future, and it would seem, then, that the 
perpetuation of the species is the correlative of his individual limitation. Thus we can regard 
the phenomenon of reproduction as founded in the very nature of being. But we must stop 
there. The perpetuation of the species does not necessitate sexual differentiation. True 
enough, this differentiation is characteristic of existents to such an extent that it belongs in 
any realistic definition of existence. But it nevertheless remains true that both a mind without 
a body and an immortal man are strictly inconceivable, whereas we can imagine a 
parthenogenetic or hermaphroditic society.

On the respective functions of the two sexes man has entertained a great variety of beliefs. 
At first they had no scientific basis, simply reflecting social myths. It was long thought – and 
it still is believed in certain primitive matriarchal societies – that the father plays no part in 
conception. Ancestral spirits in the form of living germs are supposed to find their way into 
the maternal body. With the advent patriarchal institutions, the male laid eager claim to his 
posterity. It was still necessary to grant the mother a part in procreation, but it was conceded 
only that she carried and nourished the living seed, created by the father alone. Aristotle 
fancied that the foetus arose from the union of sperm and menstrual blood, woman 
furnishing only passive matter while the male principle contributed force, activity, 
movement, life. Hippocrates held to a similar doctrine, recognising two kinds of seed, the 
weak or female and the strong or male. The theory of Aristotle survived through the Middle 
Ages and into modern times.

At the end of the seventeenth century Harvey killed female dogs shortly after copulation and 
found in the horns of the uterus small sacs that he thought were eggs but that were really 
embryos. The Danish anatomist Steno gave the name of ovaries to the female genital glands, 
previously called ‘feminine testicles’, and noted on their surface the small swellings that von 
Graaf in 1677 erroneously identified with the eggs and that are now called Graafian follicles. 
The ovary was still regarded as homologous to the male gland. In the same year, however, 
the ‘spermatic animalcules’ were discovered and it was proved that they penetrated into the 
uterus of the female; but it was supposed that they were simply nourished therein and that 
the coming individual was preformed in them. In 1694 a Dutchman, Hartsaker, drew a picture 
of the ‘homunculus’ hidden in the spermatozoan, and in 1699, another scientist said that he 
had seen the spermatozoan cast off a kind of moult under which appeared a little man, 
which he also drew. Under these imaginative hypotheses, woman was restricted to the 
nourishment of an active, living principle already preformed in perfection. These notions 
were not universally accepted, and they were argued into the nineteenth century. The use of 
the microscope enabled von Baer in 1827 to discover the mammalian egg, contained inside 
the Graaflan follicle. Before long it was possible to study the cleavage of the egg – that is, the 
early stage of development through cell division – and in 1835 sarcode, later called 
protoplasm, was discovered and the true nature of the cell began to be realised. In 1879 the 
penetration of the spermatozoan into the starfish egg was observed, and thereupon the 
equivalence of the nuclei of the two gametes, egg and sperm, was established. The details 
of their union within the fertilised egg were first worked out in 1883 by a Belgian zoologist, 
van Beneden.

Aristotle’s ideas were not wholly discredited, however. Hegel held that the two sexes were of 
necessity different, the one active and the other passive, and of course the female would be 
the passive one. ‘Thus man, in consequence of that differentiation, is the active principle 
while woman is the passive principle because she remains undeveloped in her 
unity.’ [Hegel, Philosophy of Nature] And even after the egg had been recognised as an active 
principle, men still tried to make a point of its quiescence as contrasted with the lively 
movements of the sperm. Today one notes an opposite tendency on the part of some 
scientists. The discoveries made in the course of experiments on parthenogenesis have led 
them to reduce the function of the sperm to that of a simple physico-chemical reagent. It 
has been shown that in certain species the stimulus of an acid or even of a needle-prick is 
enough to initiate the cleavage of the egg and the development of the embryo. On this basis 
it has been boldly suggested that the male gamete (sperm) is not necessary for reproduction, 
that it acts at most as a ferment; further, that perhaps in time the co-operation of the male 
will become unnecessary in procreation – the answer, it would seem, to many a woman’s 
prayer. But there is no warrant for so bold an expectation, for nothing warrants us in 
universalising specific life processes. The phenomena of asexual propagation and of 
parthenogenesis appear to be neither more nor less fundamental than those of sexual 
reproduction. I have said that the latter has no claim a priori to be considered basic; but 
neither does any fact indicate that it is reducible to any more fundamental mechanism.

Thus, admitting no a priori doctrine, no dubious theory, we are confronted by a fact for which 
we can offer no basis in the nature of things nor any explanation through observed data, and 
the significance of which we cannot comprehend a priori. We can hope to grasp the 
significance of sexuality only by studying it in its concrete manifestations; and then perhaps 
the meaning of the word female will stand revealed.

I do not intend to offer here a philosophy of life; and I do not care to take sides prematurely 
in the dispute between the mechanistic and the purposive or teleological philosophies. It is 
to be noted, however, that all physiologists and biologists use more or less finalistic 
language, if only because they ascribe meaning to vital phenomena. I shall adopt their 
terminology without taking any stand on the relation between life and consciousness, we 
can assert that every biological fact implies transcendence, that every function involves a 
project, something to be done. Let my words be taken to imply no more than that.
