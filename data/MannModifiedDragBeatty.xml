<powersystem>
They say I have attachment disorder
from years in the <class housing="orphanage">orphanage</class>-I say
I'm attached to dirt: to the grit
of stones, pulverized metal from
the slag heap, I learned touch
from air, I fashioned love from
strangers. Your families make no sense to me.
My <patriarchy role="mother">mother</patriarchy>'s the 4 barrel of a 409,
my heart's dragstripped
from the shredded tires
of predators. Go ahead,
think of me-
throw the red flag down.
I'm one you never figured,
dead engine start on a quarter-mile strip,
my lo-jack is the split/
the pull away-
you back there,
me running the distance.
