    AFTER THE DEATH OF GOD THE FATHER
    Women's Liberation and the transformation of Christian consciousness
    .11A It Y 1IALY
    The women's liberation movement has produced a deluge of books and articles. Their major task has been
    exposition and criticism of our male-centered heritage.
    In order to reveal and drive home to readers the oppressive character of our cultural institutions, it was necessary to do careful research, to trot out passages from
    leading philosophers, psychologists, statesmen, poets, historians, saints and theologians which make the reader's
    hair stand on end by the blat.mcy of their misogynism.
    Part of the task also has been the tracing of the subtle
    psychological mechanisms by which society has held men
    up and women down. This method of exposition and analysis reached its crescendo within this past year when
    Kate Millet's Sexual Politics rocketed her into the role
    of American counterpart to Simone de Beauvoir.
    As far as the level of creative research is concerned,
    that phase of the work is finished. The skeletons in our
    cultural closet have been hauled out for inspection. I do
    not mean to imply that there are not countless more of
    the same to be uncovered (just the other day I noticed
    for the first time that Berdyacv blandly affirms there is
    "something base and sinister in the female element." Etcetera). Nor do I mean that the task of communicating
    the message is over. Millions have yet to hear the news,
    let alone to grasp its import. Certainly it would be a
    mistake and a betrayal to trivialize the fact that our
    culture is so diseased. That has always been a major
    tactic in the fine art of suppressing the rage of women.
    No, what I am saying is that Phase tOne of critical research and writing in the movement has opened the way
    for the logical next step in creative thinking. We now
    marv   Daly,  author  of  The   Church   and   the   Second   Sex,   is
    associate professor of tliealogy al Boston College.
    have to ask how the women's revolution can and should
    change our whole vision of reality. What I intend to do
    here is to sketch some of the ways in which it can influence Western religious thought.
    The Judaic-Christian tradition has served to legitimate
    sexually unbalanced patriarchal society. Thus, for example, the image of the Father God, spawned in the human imagination and sustained as plausible by patriarchy,
    has in turn rendered service to this type of society by
    making its mechanisms for the oppression of women appear right and fitting. If God in "his" heaven is a father
    ruling "his" people, then it is in the "nature" of things
    and according to divine plan and the order of the universe that society be male-dominated. Theologian Karl
    Barth found it appropriate to write that woman is "on-
    tologically" subordinate to man. Within this context a
    mystification of roles takes place: the husb*and dominating his wife represents God himself. What is happening,
    of course, is the familiar mechanism by which the images
    and values of a given society are projected into 'a realm
    of beliefs, which in turn justify the social infrastructure.
    The belief system becomes hardened and objectified,
    seeming to have an unchangeable independent existence
    and validity of its own. It resists social change which
    would rob it of its plausibility. Nevertheless, despite the
    vicious circle, change does occur in society, and ideologies die. though they die hard.
    As the women's revolution begins to have its effect
    upon the fabric of society, transforming it from patriarchy
    into something that never existed before—into a diarchal
    situation that is radically new—it will, I believe, become
    the greatest single potential challenge to Christianity to
    rid itself of its oppressive tendencies or go out of business. Beliefs and values that have held sway for thous-
    ands of years will be questioned as never before. It is
    also very possibly the greatest single hope for survival of
    religious consciousness in the West.
    At this point it is important to consider the objection
    that the liberation of women will only mean that new
    characters will assume the same old roles, but that nothing will change essentially in regard to structure, ideology, or values. This objection is often based upon the
    observation that the very few women in "masculine" occupations seem to behave very much as men do. This is
    really not to the point for it fails to recognize that the
    effect of tokenism is not to change stereotypes or social
    systems but to preserve these. What I am discussing here
    is an emergence of women such as has never taken place
    before. It is naive to assume that the coming of women
    into equal power in society generally and in the church
    in particular will simply mean uncritical acceptance of
    values formerly given priority by men. Rather, I suggest
    that it will be a catalyst for transformation of our culture.
    The roles and structures of patriarchy have been developed and sustained in accordance with an artificial
    polarization of human qualities into the traditional sexual
    stereotypes. The image of the person in authority and the
    accepted understanding of "his" role have corresponded
    to the eternal masculine stereotype, which implies hyper-
    rationality, "objectivity," aggressivity, the possession of
    dominating and manipulative attitudes toward persons
    and environment and the tendency to construct boundaries between the self (and those identified with the self)
    and "the other." The caricature of a human being which
    is represented by this stereotype depends for its existence
    upon the opposite caricature —the eternal feminine (hyper-emotional, passive, self-abasing, etc.). By becoming
    whole persons women can generate a counterforce to the
    stereotype of the leader as they challenge the artificial
    polarization of human characteristics. There is no reason
    to assume that women who have the support of their
    sisters to criticize the masculine stereotype will simply
    adopt it as a model for themselves. More likely they will
    develop a wider range of qualities and skills in themselves
    and thereby encourage men to engage in a comparably
    liberating procedure (a phenomenon we are beginning
    to witness already in men's liberation groups). This becoming of whole human beings will affect the values of
    our society, for it will involve a change in the fabric of
    human consciousness.
    Accordingly, it is reasonable to anticipate that this
    change will affect the symbols which reflect the values of
    our society, including religious symbols. Since some of
    these have functioned to justify oppression, women and
    men would do well to welcome this change. Religious
    symbols die when the cultural situation that supported
    them ceases to give them plausibility. This should pose
    no problem to authentic faith, which accepts the relativity of all symbols and recognizes that fixation upon any
    of them as absolute in itself is idolatrous.
    The becoming of new symbols is not a matter that can
    arbitrarily be decided around a conference table. Rather,
    they grow out of a changing communal situation and experience. This does not mean that theologically we are
    consigned to the role of passive spectators. We are called
    upon to be attentive to what the new experience of the
    becoming of women is revealing to us, and to foster the
    evolution of consciousness beyond the oppressiveness and
    imbalance reflected and justified by symbols and doctrines throughout the millennia of patriarchy.
    This imbalance is apparent first of all in the biblical
    and popular image of trie great patriarch in heaven who
    rewards and punishes according to his mysterious and
    arbitrary will. The fact that the effects of this image have
    not always been humanizing is evident to any perceptive
    reader of history. The often cruel behavior of Christians
    toward unbelievers and even toward dissenters among
    themselves is shocking evidence of the function of that
    image in relation to values and behavior.
    Sophisticated thinkers, of course, have never intellectually identified God with an elderly parent in heaven.
    Nevertheless it is important to recognize that even when
    very abstract conceptualizations of God arc formulated
    in the mind, images have a way of surviving in the imagination in such a way that a person can function on two
    different and even apparently contradictory levels at the
    same time. Thus one can speak of God as spirit and at
    the same time imagine "him" as belonging to the male
    sex. Such primitive images can profoundly affect conceptualizations which appear to be very refined and abstract.
    Even the Yahwch of the future, so cherished by the
    theology of hope, comes through on an imaginative level
    as exclusively a He-God, and it is perhaps consistent
    with this that theologians of hope have attempted to
    develop a political theology which takes no explicit cognizance of the devastation wrought by sexual politics.
    The widespread conception of the "Supreme Being" as
    an entity distinct from this world but controlling it according to plan and keeping human beings in a state of
    infantile subjection has been a not too subtle mask of
    the divine patriarch. The Supreme Being's plausibility,
    and that of the static worldview which accompanies this
    projection has, of course, declined. This was a projection
    grounded in specifically patriarchal infrastructures and
    sustained as subjectively real by the usual processes of
    generating plausibility. The sustaining power of the social
    infrastructures has been eroded by a number of developments in recent history, including the general trend toward democratization of society and the emergence of
    technology with the accompanying sense of mastery over'
    the world and man's destiny. However, it is the women's
    movement which appears destined to play the key-role in
    the overthrow of such oppressive elements in traditional
    theism, precisely because it strikes at the source of the
    imbalance reflected in traditional beliefs.
    The women's movement will present a growing threat
    to patriarchal religion less by attacking it than by simply
    leaving it behind. Few of the leaders in the movement
    evince an interest in institutional religion, having recognized it as an instrument of their betrayal. Those who see
    their commitment to the movement as consonant with
    concern for the religious heritage are aware that the
    Christian tradition is by no means bereft of elements
    which foster genuine experiences and intimations of
    transcendence. The problem is that their liberating potential is choked off in the surrounding atmosphere of
    the images, ideas, values, and structures of patriarchy.
    What will, I think, become possible through the social
    change coming from radical feminism is a more acute
    and widespread perception of qualitative differences between those conceptualizations of God and of the human relationship to God which are oppressive in their
    implications, and those which encourage self-actualization
    and social commitment.
    The various theologies that hypostatize transcendence
    invariably use this "God" to legitimate oppression, particularly that of women. These are irredeemably anti-
    feminine and therefore anti-human. In contrast to this,
    a more authentic language of transcendence does not hypostatize or objectify God and consequently does not
    lend itself to such use. So for example, Tillich's way of
    speaking about God as ground and power of being would
    be very difficult to use for the legitimation of any sort
    of oppression. It grows out of awareness of that reality
    which is both transcendent and immanent, not reducible
    to or adequately represented by such expressions as person, father, supreme being. Awareness of this reality is
    not achieved by playing theological games but by existential courage. I am not saying that a liberated consciousness necessarily will use Tillich's language of transcendence. That of Whitehead, James, Jaspers, to mention a few—or an entirely new language—may do as
    well or better. But it remains true that the driving revelatory force which will make possible an authenticity of
    religious consciousness is courage in the face of anxiety.
    Since the projections of patriarchal religion have been
    blocking the dynamics of existential courage by otlering
    the false security of alienation—that is, of self-reduction
    to stereotyped roles—there is reason to see hope for the
    emergence of genuine religious consciousness in the massive challenge to patriarchy which is now in its initial
    stages. The becoming of women may be not only the
    doorway to deliverance from the omnipotent Father in all
    of his disguises—a deliverance which secular humanism
    has passionately fought for—but also a doorway to something, that is, the beginning for many of a more authentic
    search for transcendence, that is, for God.
    The imbalance in Christian ideology resulting from
    sexual hierarchy is manifested not only in the doctrine
    of God but also in the notion of Jesus as the unique
    God-man. A great deal of Christian doctrine"concerning
    Jesus has been docetic, that is, it has not really seriously
    accepted the fact that Jesus was a human being. An effect
    of the liberation of women will very likely be the
    loss of plausibility of Christological formulas which come
    close to reflecting a kind of idolatry in regard to the person of Jesus. As it becomes better understood that God
    is transcendent and unobjcctifiable—or else not at all—
    it will become less plausible to speak of Jesus as the
    Second Person of the Trinity who "assumed" a human
    nature. Indeed, the prevalent emphasis upon the total
    uniqueness and supereminence of Jesus will, I think, become less meaningful. To say this is not at all to deny
    his extraordinary character and mission. The point is
    to attempt a realistic assessment of certain ways of using
    his image (which in all likelihood he himself would repudiate). It is still not uncommon for priests and ministers, when confronted with the issue of women's liberation, to assert that God become incarnate uniquely
    as a male, and then to draw arguments for male
    supremacy from this. Indeed, the tradition itself tends
    to justify such assertions. The underlying—and often
    explicit—assumption in the minds of theologians down
    through the centuries has been that the divinity could
    not have deigned to become incarnate in the "inferior"
    sex, and the "fact" that "he" did not do so reinforces
    the belief in masculine superiority/ The transformation
    of society by the erosion of male dominance will generate serious challenges to such assumptions of the
    Christological tradition.
    It will, I think, become increasingly evident that exclusively masculine symbols for the ideal of "incarnation" will not do. As a uniquely masculine divinity loses
    credibility, so also the idea of a unique divine incarnation in a human being of the male sex may give way
    in the religious consciousness to an increased awareness
    of the divine presence in all human beings, understood
    as expressing and in a real sense incarnating—although
    always inadequately—the power of being. The seeds of
    this awareness are already present, of course, in the
    traditional doctrine that all human beings are made to
    the image of God and in a less than adequate way in
    the doctrine of grace. Now it should become possible
    to work out with increasing realism the implication in
    both of these doctrines that human beings are called
    to self-actualization and to the creation of a community
    that fosters the becoming of women and men. This
    means that no completely adequate models can be taken
    from the past. It may be that we will witness a re-
    mythologizing of Western religion. Certainly, if the need
    for parental symbols for God persists, something like
    the Father-Mother God proposed by Mary Baker Eddy
    will be more acceptable to the new woman and the
    new man than the Father God of the past. A symbolism for incarnation of the divine in human beings may
    continue to be needed in the future, but it is highly
    unlikely that women or men will continue to find
    plausible that symbolism which is epitomized in the
    image of the Virgin kneeling in adoration before her
    own son. Perhaps this will be replaced by the emergence
    t of bisexual imagery which is not hierarchical. The experience of the past brought forth a new Adam and a
    new Eve. Perhaps the future will bring a new Christ
    and a new Mary. For the present, it would appear that
    we arc being called upon to recognize the poverty of
    all symbols and the fact of our past idolatry regarding
    them, and to turn to our own resources for bringing
    about the radically new in our own lives.
    The manifestation of God in Jesus was an cschato-
    logical event whose fulfilled reality lies in the future. The
    Jesus of the Gospels was a free person who challenged
    ossified beliefs and laws. Since he was remarkably free
    of prejudice against women and treated them as equals
    insofar as the limitations of his culture 'would allow, it
    is certain that he would be working with them for their
    liberation today. This awakening of women to their
    human potentiality by creative action as they assume
    equal partnership with men in society can bring about
    a manifestation of God in themselves which will be the
    Second Coming of God incarnate, fulfilling the latent
    promise in the original revelation that men and women
    are made to the image of God.
    Behind the Mask
    It should be evident, then, that women's liberation is
    an event that can challenge authoritarian, exclusive and
    non-existential notions of faith and revelation. Since
    women have been extra-environmentals, to use a
    McLuhanish term, that is, since they have not been
    part of the authority structure which uses "faith" and
    "revelation" to reinforce the mechanisms of alienation,
    their emergence can effect a more widespread critical-
    ness of idolatry which is often masked by these ideas.
    There could result from this a more general understanding of faith as a state of ultimate concern and
    commitment and a heightened sense of relativity concerning the symbols it uses to express this commitment.
    An awareness might also emerge—not merely in the
    minds of a  theological elite, but in the general con
    sciousness—that revelation is an ongoing experience.
    The becoming of women implies also a transvaluation
    of values in Christian morality. As the old order is challenged and as men and women become freed to experience a wholeness of personality which the old polarizations impeded, the potentiality will be awakened for a
    change in moral consciousness which will go far beyond
    Nietzsche's merely reactionary rejection of Christian
    values.
    Much of the traditional theory of Christian virtue appears to be the product of reactions on the part of men
    —perhaps guilty reactions—to the behavioral excesses
    of the stereotypic male. There has been theoretical emphasis upon charity, meekness, obedience, humility, self-
    abnegation, sacrifice, service. Part of the problem with
    this moral ideology is that it became generally accepted
    not by men but by women, who have hardly been
    helped by an ethic which reinforced their abject situation. This emphasis upon the passive virtues, of course,
    has not challenged exploitativeness but supported it. Part
    of the syndrome is the prevailing notion of sin as an
    offense against those in power, or against "God" (the
    two are often equated). Within the perspective of such
    a privatized morality the structures themselves of op-
    ' pression arc not seen as sinful.
    Consistent with all of this is the fact that the traditional Christian moral consciousness has been fixated
    upon the problems of reproductive activity in a manner
    totally disproportionate to its feeble political concern.
    This was summed up several years ago in Archbishop
    Roberts' remark that • "if contraceptives had been
    dropped over Japan instead of bombs which merely
    killed, maimed and shriveled up thousands alive there
    would have been a squeal of outraged protest from
    the Vatican to the remotest Mass center in Asia."
    Pertinent also is Simone de Beauvoir's remark that the
    church has reserved its uncompromising humanitarian-
    ism for man in the fetal condition. Although theologians
    today acknowledge that this privatized morality has
    failed to cope with the structures of oppression, few
    seriously face the possibility that the roots of this distortion are deeply buried in the fundamental and all-
    pervasive sexual alienation which the women's movement is seeking to overcome.
    It is well-known that Christians under the spell of
    the jealous God who represents the coliective power of
    his chosen people can use religion to justify that "us
    and them" attitude which is disastrous in its consequences for the powerless. It is less widely understood
    that the projection of "the other"—easily adaptable
    to national, racial and class differences—has basically
    and primordially been directed against women. Even the
    rhetoric of racism finds its model in sexism.
    The consciousness-raising which is beginning among
    women is evoking a qualitatively new understanding cf
    the subtle mechanisms which produce and destroy "the
    other," and a consequent empathy with all of the oppressed. This gives grounds for the hope that their
    emergence can generate a counterforce to the exploitative mentality which is destroying persons and the environment. Since the way men and women are seen in
    society is a prime determinant in the whole social system and ideology, radical women refuse to see their
    movement as simply one among others. What I am
    suggesting is that it might be the only chance for the
    turning of human beings from a course leading to the
    deterioration and perhaps the end of life on this planet.
    Those who see their concern for women's liberation
    as consonant with an evolving Christianity would be
    unrealistic to expect much comprehension from the
    majority of male ecclesiastics. Such writers as Gordon
    Rattrey Taylor (The Biological Time Bomb),  Robert
    Francoeur (Utopian Motherhood), and others ke«p
    beeping out the message that we are moving into a
    world in which human sexuality is no longer merely
    oriented to reproduction of the species—which means
    that the masculine and feminine mystiques are doomed
    to evaporate. Within the theological community, however, the predictable and almost universal response has
    been what one might call the ostrich syndrome. Whereas
    the old theology justified sexual oppression, the new
    theology for the most part simply ignores it and goes
    on in comfortable compatibility with it, failing to
    recognize its deep connection with such other major
    problems as war, racism and environmental pollution.
    The work of fostering religious consciousness which is
    explicitly incompatible with sexism will require an
    extraordinary degree of creative rage, love and hope.
