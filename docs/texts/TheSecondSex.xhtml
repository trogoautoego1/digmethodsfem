      <h1>The Second Sex</h1>
      
      <p>
         WOMAN? Very simple, say the fanciers of simple formulas: she is a womb, an ovary;
         she is a
         female – this word is sufficient to define her. In the mouth of a man the epithet
         female has
         the sound of an insult, yet he is not ashamed of his animal nature; on the contrary,
         he is
         proud if someone says of him: ‘He is a male!’ The term ‘female’ is derogatory not
         because it
         emphasises woman’s animality, but because it imprisons her in her sex; and if this
         sex 
         seems to man to be contemptible and inimical even in harmless dumb animals, it is
         
         evidently because of the uneasy hostility stirred up in him by woman. Nevertheless
         he 
         wishes to find in biology a justification for this sentiment. The word female brings
         up in his 
         mind a saraband of imagery – a vast, round ovum engulfs and castrates the agile 
         spermatozoan; the monstrous and swollen termite queen rules over the enslaved males;
         the 
         female praying mantis and the spider, satiated with love, crush and devour their partners;
         
         the bitch in heat runs through the alleys, trailing behind her a wake of depraved
         odours; the 
         she-monkey presents posterior immodestly and then steals away with hypocritical 
         coquetry; and the most superb wild beasts – the tigress, the lioness, the panther
         – bed down 
         slavishly under the imperial embrace of the male. Females sluggish, eager, artful,
         stupid, 
         callous, lustful, ferocious, abased – man projects them all at once upon woman. And
         the 
         fact is that she is a female. But if we are willing to stop thinking in platitudes,
         two questions 
         are immediately posed: what does the female denote in the animal kingdom? And what
         
         particular kind of female is manifest in woman?
         </p>
      
      <p>
         Males and females are two types of individuals which are differentiated within a species
         for 
         the function of reproduction; they can be defined only correlatively. But first it
         must be noted 
         that even the division of a species into two sexes is not always clear-cut.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         In nature it is not universally manifested. To speak only of animals, it is well known
         that 
         among the microscopic one-celled forms – infusoria, amoebae, sporozoans, and the like
         – 
         multiplication is fundamentally distinct from sexuality. Each cell divides and subdivides
         by 
         itself. In many-celled animals or metazoans reproduction may take place asexually,
         either 
         by schizogenesis – that is, by fission or cutting into two or more parts which become
         new 
         individuals – or by blastogenesis – that is, by buds that separate and form new individuals.
         
         The phenomena of budding observed in the fresh-water hydra and other coelenterates,
         in 
         sponges, worms, and tunicates, are well-known examples. In cases of parthenogenesis
         the 
         egg of the virgin female develops into an embryo without fertilisation by the male,
         which thus 
         may play no role at all. In the honey-bee copulation takes place, but the eggs may
         or may not 
         be fertilised at the time of laying. The unfertilised eggs undergo development and
         produce 
         the drones (males); in the aphids males are absent during a series of generations
         in which 
         the eggs are unfertilised and produce females. Parthenogenesis has been induced artificially
         
         in the sea urchin, the starfish, the frog, and other species. Among the one-celled
         animals 
         (Protozoa), however, two cells may fuse, forming what is called a zygote; and in the
         honey-
         bee fertilisation is necessary if the eggs are to produce females. In the aphids both
         males 
         and females appear in the autumn, and the fertilised eggs then produced are adapted
         for 
         over-wintering.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         Certain biologists in the past concluded from these facts that even in species capable
         of 
         asexual propagation occasional fertilisation is necessary to renew the vigour of the
         race – to 
         accomplish ‘rejuvenation’ through the mixing of hereditary material from two individuals.
         On 
         this hypothesis sexuality might well appear to be an indispensable function in the
         most 
         complex forms of life; only the lower organisms could multiply without sexuality,
         and even 
         here vitality would after a time become exhausted. But today this hypothesis is largely
         
         abandoned; research has proved that under suitable conditions asexual multiplication
         can 
         go on indefinitely without noticeable degeneration, a fact that is especially striking
         in the 
         bacteria and Protozoa. More and more numerous and daring experiments in 
         parthenogenesis are being performed, and in many species the male appears to be 
         fundamentally unnecessary. Besides, if the value of intercellular exchange were 
         demonstrated, that value would seem to stand as a sheer, unexplained fact. Biology
         
         certainly demonstrates the existence of sexual differentiation, but from the point
         of view of 
         any end to be attained the science could not infer such differentiation from the structure
         of 
         the cell, nor from the laws of cellular multiplication, nor from any basic phenomenon.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         The production of two types of gametes, the sperm and the egg, does not necessarily
         imply 
         the existence of two distinct sexes; as a matter of fact, egg and sperm – two highly
         
         differentiated types of reproductive cells – may both be produced by the same individual.
         
         This occurs in normally hermaphroditic species, which are common among plants and
         are 
         also to be found among the lower animals, such as annelid worms and molluscs. In them
         
         reproduction may be accomplished through self-fertilisation or, more commonly, cross-
         fertilisation. Here again certain biologists have attempted to account for the existing
         state of 
         affairs. Some hold that the separation of the gonads (ovaries and testes) in two distinct
         
         individuals represents an evolutionary advance over hermaphroditism; others on the
         
         contrary regard the separate condition as primitive, and believe that hermaphroditism
         
         represents a degenerate state. These notions regarding the superiority of one system
         or the 
         other imply the most debatable evolutionary theorising. All that we can say for sure
         is that 
         these two modes of reproduction coexist in nature, that they both succeed in accomplishing
         
         the survival of the species concerned, and that the differentiation of the gametes,
         like that 
         of the organisms producing them, appears to be accidental. It would seem, then, that
         the 
         division of a species into male and female individuals is simply an irreducible fact
         of 
         observation.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         In most philosophies this fact has been taken for granted without pretence of explanation.
         
         According to the Platonic myth, there were at the beginning men, women, and 
         hermaphrodites. Each individual had two faces, four arms, four legs, and two conjoined
         
         bodies. At a certain time they were split in two, and ever since each half seeks to
         rejoin its 
         corresponding half. Later the gods decreed that new human beings should be created
         
         through the coupling of dissimilar halves. But it is only love that this story is
         intended to 
         explain; division into sexes is assumed at the outset. Nor does Aristotle explain
         this division, 
         for if matter and form must cooperate in all action, there is no necessity for the
         active and 
         passive principles to he separated in two different categories of individuals. Thus
         St Thomas 
         proclaims woman an ‘incidental’ being, which is a way of suggesting – from the male
         point 
         of view – the accidental or contingent nature of sexuality. Hegel, however, would
         have been 
         untrue to his passion for rationalism had he failed to attempt a logical explanation.
         Sexuality 
         in his view represents the medium through which the subject attains a concrete sense
         of 
         belonging to a particular kind (genre). ‘The sense of kind is produced in the subject
         as an 
         effect which offsets this disproportionate sense of his individual reality, as a desire
         to find 
         the sense of himself in another individual of his species through union with this
         other, 
         to complete himself and thus to incorporate the kind (genre) within his own nature
         and bring 
         it into existence. This is copulation’ (Philosophy of Nature, Part 3, Section 369).
         And a little 
         farther on. ‘The process consists in this, namely: that which they are in themselves,
         that is 
         to say a single kind, one and the same subjective life, they also establish it as
         such.’ And 
         Hegel states later that for the uniting process to be accomplished, there must first
         be sexual 
         differentiation. But his exposition is not convincing: one feels in it all too distinctly
         the 
         predetermination to find in every operation the three terms of the syllogism.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         The projection or transcendence of the individual towards the species, in which both
         
         individual and species are fulfilled, could be accomplished without the intervention
         of a third 
         element in the simple relation of progenitor to offspring; that is to say, reproduction
         could be 
         asexual. Or, if there were to be two progenitors, they could be similar (as happens
         in 
         hermaphroditic species) and differentiated only as particular individuals of a single
         type. 
         Hegel’s discussion reveals a most important significance of sexuality, but his mistake
         is 
         always to argue from significance to necessity, to equate significance with necessity.
         Man 
         gives significance to the sexes and their relations through sexual activity, just
         as he gives 
         sense and value to all the functions that he exercises; but sexual activity is not
         necessarily 
         implied in the nature of the human being. Merleau-Ponty notes in the Phénoménologie
         de la 
         perception that human existence requires us to revise our ideas of necessity and 
         contingence. ‘Existence,’ he says, ‘has no casual, fortuitous qualities, no content
         that does 
         not contribute to the formation of its aspect; it does not admit the notion of sheer
         fact, for it 
         is only through existence that the facts are manifested.’ True enough. But it is also
         true that 
         there are conditions without which the very fact of existence itself would seem to
         be 
         impossible. To be present in the world implies strictly that there exists a body which
         is at 
         once a material thing in the world and a point of view towards this world; but nothing
         requires 
         that this body have this or that particular structure. Sartre discusses in L’Étre
         et le 
         néant Heidegger’s dictum to the effect that the real nature of man is bound up with
         death 
         because of man’s finite state. He shows that an existence which is finite and yet
         unlimited in 
         time is conceivable; but none the less if death were not resident in human life, the
         relation 
         of man to the world and to himself would be profoundly disarranged – so much so that
         the 
         statement ‘Man is mortal’ would be seen to have significance quite other than that
         of a mere 
         fact of observation. Were he immortal, an existent would no longer be what we call
         a man. 
         One of the essential features of his career is that the progress of his life through
         time creates 
         behind him and before him the infinite past and future, and it would seem, then, that
         the 
         perpetuation of the species is the correlative of his individual limitation. Thus
         we can regard 
         the phenomenon of reproduction as founded in the very nature of being. But we must
         stop 
         there. The perpetuation of the species does not necessitate sexual differentiation.
         True 
         enough, this differentiation is characteristic of existents to such an extent that
         it belongs in 
         any realistic definition of existence. But it nevertheless remains true that both
         a mind without 
         a body and an immortal man are strictly inconceivable, whereas we can imagine a 
         parthenogenetic or hermaphroditic society.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         On the respective functions of the two sexes man has entertained a great variety of
         beliefs. 
         At first they had no scientific basis, simply reflecting social myths. It was long
         thought – and 
         it still is believed in certain primitive matriarchal societies – that the father
         plays no part in 
         conception. Ancestral spirits in the form of living germs are supposed to find their
         way into 
         the maternal body. With the advent patriarchal institutions, the male laid eager claim
         to his 
         posterity. It was still necessary to grant the mother a part in procreation, but it
         was conceded 
         only that she carried and nourished the living seed, created by the father alone.
         Aristotle 
         fancied that the foetus arose from the union of sperm and menstrual blood, woman 
         furnishing only passive matter while the male principle contributed force, activity,
         
         movement, life. Hippocrates held to a similar doctrine, recognising two kinds of seed,
         the 
         weak or female and the strong or male. The theory of Aristotle survived through the
         Middle 
         Ages and into modern times.

         At the end of the seventeenth century Harvey killed female dogs shortly after copulation
         and 
         found in the horns of the uterus small sacs that he thought were eggs but that were
         really 
         embryos. The Danish anatomist Steno gave the name of ovaries to the female genital
         glands, 
         previously called ‘feminine testicles’, and noted on their surface the small swellings
         that von 
         Graaf in 1677 erroneously identified with the eggs and that are now called Graafian
         follicles. 
         The ovary was still regarded as homologous to the male gland. In the same year, however,
         
         the ‘spermatic animalcules’ were discovered and it was proved that they penetrated
         into the 
         uterus of the female; but it was supposed that they were simply nourished therein
         and that 
         the coming individual was preformed in them. In 1694 a Dutchman, Hartsaker, drew a
         picture 
         of the ‘homunculus’ hidden in the spermatozoan, and in 1699, another scientist said
         that he 
         had seen the spermatozoan cast off a kind of moult under which appeared a little man,
         
         which he also drew. Under these imaginative hypotheses, woman was restricted to the
         
         nourishment of an active, living principle already preformed in perfection. These
         notions 
         were not universally accepted, and they were argued into the nineteenth century. The
         use of 
         the microscope enabled von Baer in 1827 to discover the mammalian egg, contained inside
         
         the Graaflan follicle. Before long it was possible to study the cleavage of the egg
         – that is, the 
         early stage of development through cell division – and in 1835 sarcode, later called
         
         protoplasm, was discovered and the true nature of the cell began to be realised. In
         1879 the 
         penetration of the spermatozoan into the starfish egg was observed, and thereupon
         the 
         equivalence of the nuclei of the two gametes, egg and sperm, was established. The
         details 
         of their union within the fertilised egg were first worked out in 1883 by a Belgian
         zoologist, 
         van Beneden.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         Aristotle’s ideas were not wholly discredited, however. Hegel held that the two sexes
         were of 
         necessity different, the one active and the other passive, and of course the female
         would be 
         the passive one. ‘Thus man, in consequence of that differentiation, is the active
         principle 
         while woman is the passive principle because she remains undeveloped in her 
         unity.’ [Hegel, Philosophy of Nature] And even after the egg had been recognised as
         an active 
         principle, men still tried to make a point of its quiescence as contrasted with the
         lively 
         movements of the sperm. Today one notes an opposite tendency on the part of some 
         scientists. The discoveries made in the course of experiments on parthenogenesis have
         led 
         them to reduce the function of the sperm to that of a simple physico-chemical reagent.
         It 
         has been shown that in certain species the stimulus of an acid or even of a needle-prick
         is 
         enough to initiate the cleavage of the egg and the development of the embryo. On this
         basis 
         it has been boldly suggested that the male gamete (sperm) is not necessary for reproduction,
         
         that it acts at most as a ferment; further, that perhaps in time the co-operation
         of the male 
         will become unnecessary in procreation – the answer, it would seem, to many a woman’s
         
         prayer. But there is no warrant for so bold an expectation, for nothing warrants us
         in 
         universalising specific life processes. The phenomena of asexual propagation and of
         
         parthenogenesis appear to be neither more nor less fundamental than those of sexual
         
         reproduction. I have said that the latter has no claim a priori to be considered basic;
         but 
         neither does any fact indicate that it is reducible to any more fundamental mechanism.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         Thus, admitting no a priori doctrine, no dubious theory, we are confronted by a fact
         for which 
         we can offer no basis in the nature of things nor any explanation through observed
         data, and 
         the significance of which we cannot comprehend a priori. We can hope to grasp the
         
         significance of sexuality only by studying it in its concrete manifestations; and
         then perhaps 
         the meaning of the word female will stand revealed.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         I do not intend to offer here a philosophy of life; and I do not care to take sides
         prematurely 
         in the dispute between the mechanistic and the purposive or teleological philosophies.
         It is 
         to be noted, however, that all physiologists and biologists use more or less finalistic
         
         language, if only because they ascribe meaning to vital phenomena. I shall adopt their
         
         terminology without taking any stand on the relation between life and consciousness,
         we 
         can assert that every biological fact implies transcendence, that every function involves
         a 
         project, something to be done. Let my words be taken to imply no more than that.
