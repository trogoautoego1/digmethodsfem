      <h1>Excerpt from Punk Planet 29</h1>
      
      <p>Carrie: It’s like they think they’re paying you a compliment by taking you out of
         the "girl group ghetto” and saying that you’ve tran¬ scended gender. But that’s never
         been our goal. I mean, <span class="tooltip fem-tooltip">how could we possibly tran¬ scend something that’s so experiential and part of who
            we are?<span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip">how could we cp</span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span></span> And why would we ever want to be "Men In Rock?” It’s not a history that we’re a part
         of nor would we like to emulate it.</p>
      
      
      <p>Janet: Maybe they’re trying to say that we’ve transcended the cliche of the girl keyboard
         player in a mini skirt.</p>
      
      
      <p>Corin: But that would be a more intelligent thing to say and they’re not saying that.
         If they had said exactly that, it would be dif¬ ferent. We’ve noticed a lot of really
         lousy, lazy journalists. They read the press kit and they write exactly what someone
         else wrote, just in different words—sometimes in the same words [laughs]. There’s
         no real con¬ text or basis for many of these people to write about us. They have very
         little to refer to when they describe women who play music. You almost have to come
         up with a whole new vocabulary, really. Rock journalism has existed for as long as
         rock music, but when they try to describe some¬ thing that doesn’t fit easily into
         that same category with the same language, it’s impossible. </p>
      
      
      <p>In a way, that’s a fault of rock journalism, which I’ve always found to be an especially
         illegitimate form of journalism. Having made attempts at going down that road before,
         I’ve gotten burned every time because, like you said, the language and framework that
         it works under is unbeliev¬ ably constricting.</p>
      
      
      <p>Janet: Complexity is just not acceptable to rock journalism. Something has to be one
         way or the other. It can’t have shades of this or shades of that. Everything has to
         be put in really plain and simple terms. </p>
      
      
      <p>Corin: It’s just such a cop out. It’s the same thing with mainstream music. They want
         it to be really simple and easy to understand. </p>
      
      
      <p>If it is music that is difficult or just com¬ plex or weird in some way, so many times
         it gets overlooked. </p>
      
      
      <p>Which is why Sleater-Kinney is such an anom¬ aly. Musically, you’re very complex.
         On its sur¬ face it seems simple, but once you break it down it’s actually really
         intricate. You have these competing guitar lines and competing vocal lines. It’s such
         an anomaly that you would have found this relative success in the main¬ stream and
         that you’d be playing venues this size and getting the amount of press that you have.
         What do you attribute that to? </p>
      
      
      <p>Janet: I think the people that do love it, love it st&gt; much. Writers see the reaction
         of our fans at shows and say, "What’s happening?” They try to explain it, and they
         do so poorly, but enough people are attracted by it that more and more people come.</p>
