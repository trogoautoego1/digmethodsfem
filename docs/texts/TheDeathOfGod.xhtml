      <h1>AFTER THE DEATH OF GOD THE FATHER Women's Liberation and the transformation of
         Christian consciousness</h1>
      
      <p>The women's liberation movement has produced a deluge of books
         and articles. Their major task has been exposition and criticism of our
         <span class="tooltip">male-centered heritage<span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip">patriarchy</span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span></span>. In order to reveal and drive home to readers the oppressive
         character of our cultural institutions, it was necessary to do careful research, to
         trot out passages from leading philosophers, psychologists, statesmen, poets,
         historians, saints and theologians which make the reader's hair stand on end by the
         blatancy of their misogynism. Part of the task also has been the tracing of the
         subtle psychological mechanisms by which society has held men up and women down.
         This method of exposition and analysis reached its crescendo within this past year
         when Kate Millet's Sexual Politics rocketed her into the role of American
         counterpart to Simone de Beauvoir. </p>
      
      <p>As far as the level of creative research is concerned, that
         phase of the work is finished. The skeletons in our cultural closet have been hauled
         out for inspection. I do not mean to imply that there are not countless more of the
         same to be uncovered (just the other day I noticed for the first time that Berdyaev
         blandly affirms <span class="tooltip">there is something base and
            sinister in the female element<span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip">patriarchy</span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span></span> ." Etcetera). Nor do I mean that
         the task of communicating the message is over. Millions have yet to hear the news,
         let alone to grasp its import. Certainly it would be a mistake and a betrayal to
         trivialize the fact that our culture is so diseased. That has always been a major
         tactic in the fine art of suppressing the rage of women. No, what I am saying is
         that Phase One of critical research and writing in the movement has opened the way
         for the logical next step in creative thinking. We now have to ask how the women's
         revolution can and should change our whole vision of reality. What I intend to do
         here is to sketch some of the ways in which it can influence Western religious
         thought. </p>
      
      <p>The 
         Judaic-Christiantradition has served to legitimate sexually
         unbalanced patriarchal society. Thus, for example, the image of the Father God,
         spawned in the human imagination and sustained as plausible by patriarchy, has in
         turn rendered service to this type of society by making its mechanisms for the
         oppression of women appear right and fitting. If God in "his" heaven is a father
         ruling "his" people, then it is in the "nature" of things and according to divine
         plan and the order of the universe that society be male-dominated. Theologian Karl
         Barth found it appropriate to write that <span class="tooltip">woman is "ontologically" subordinate to
            man.<span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip">patriarchy</span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span></span> Within this context a mystification of roles takes place: the husband
         dominating his wife represents God himself. What is happening, of course, is the
         familiar mechanism by which the images and values of a given society are projected
         into 'a realm of beliefs, which in turn justify the social infrastructure. The
         belief system becomes hardened and objectified, seeming to have an unchangeable
         independent existence and validity of its own. It resists social change which would
         rob it of its plausibility. Nevertheless, despite the vicious circle, change does
         occur in society, and ideologies die. though they die hard. </p>
      
      <p>As the women's revolution begins to have its effect upon the
         fabric of society, transforming it from <span class="tooltip">patriarchy<span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip">patriarchy</span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span></span> into something that never existed
         before—into a diarchal situation that is radically new—it will, I believe, become
         the greatest single potential challenge to Christianity to rid itself of its
         oppressive tendencies or go out of business. Beliefs and values that have held sway
         for thousands of years will be questioned as never before. It is also very possibly
         the greatest single hope for survival of religious consciousness in the West.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>At this point it is important to consider the objection that
         the liberation of women will only mean that new characters will assume the same old
         roles, but that nothing will change essentially in regard to structure, ideology,
         or
         values. This objection is often based upon the observation that the very few women
         in "masculine" occupations seem to behave very much as men do. This is really not
         to
         the point for it fails to recognize that the effect of tokenism is not to change
         stereotypes or social systems but to preserve these. What I am discussing here is
         an
         emergence of women such as has never taken place before. It is naive to assume that
         the coming of women into equal power in society generally and in the church in
         particular will simply mean uncritical acceptance of values formerly given priority
         by men. Rather, I suggest that it will be a catalyst for transformation of our
         culture. </p>
      
      <p>The roles and structures of <span class="tooltip">patriarchy<span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip">patriarchy</span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span><span class="tooltiptext" role="tooltip"></span></span> have been developed and
         sustained in accordance with an artificial polarization of human qualities into the
         traditional sexual stereotypes. The image of the person in authority and the
         accepted understanding of "his" role have corresponded to the eternal masculine
         stereotype, which implies hyper- rationality, "objectivity," aggressivity, the
         possession of dominating and manipulative attitudes toward persons and environment
         and the tendency to construct boundaries between the self (and those identified with
         the self) and "the other." The caricature of a human being which is represented by
         this stereotype depends for its existence upon the opposite caricature —the eternal
         feminine (hyper-emotional, passive, self-abasing, etc.). By becoming whole persons
         women can generate a counterforce to the stereotype of the leader as they challenge
         the artificial polarization of human characteristics. There is no reason to assume
         that women who have the support of their sisters to criticize the masculine
         stereotype will simply adopt it as a model for themselves. More likely they will
         develop a wider range of qualities and skills in themselves and thereby encourage
         men to engage in a comparably liberating procedure (a phenomenon we are beginning
         to
         witness already in men's liberation groups). This becoming of whole human beings
         will affect the values of our society, for it will involve a change in the fabric
         of
         human consciousness. </p>
      
      <p>Accordingly, it is reasonable to anticipate that this change
         will affect the symbols which reflect the values of our society, including religious
         symbols. Since some of these have functioned to justify oppression, women and men
         would do well to welcome this change. Religious symbols die when the cultural
         situation that supported them ceases to give them plausibility. This should pose no
         problem to authentic faith, which accepts the relativity of all symbols and
         recognizes that fixation upon any of them as absolute in itself is idolatrous. </p>
      
      <p>The becoming of new symbols is not a matter that can
         arbitrarily be decided around a conference table. Rather, they grow out of a
         changing communal situation and experience. This does not mean that theologically
         we
         are consigned to the role of passive spectators. We are called upon to be attentive
         to what the new experience of the becoming of women is revealing to us, and to
         foster the evolution of consciousness beyond the oppressiveness and imbalance
         reflected and justified by symbols and doctrines throughout the millennia of
         patriarchy.</p>
      
      <p>This imbalance is apparent first of all in the biblical and
         popular image of trie great patriarch in heaven who rewards and punishes according
         to his mysterious and arbitrary will. The fact that the effects of this image have
         not always been humanizing is evident to any perceptive reader of history. The often
         cruel behavior of Christians toward unbelievers and even toward dissenters among
         themselves is shocking evidence of the function of that image in relation to values
         and behavior. </p>
      
      
      <p>Sophisticated thinkers, of course, have never intellectually
         identified God with an elderly parent in heaven. Nevertheless it is important to
         recognize that even when very abstract conceptualizations of God arc formulated in
         the mind, images have a way of surviving in the imagination in such a way that a
         person can function on two different and even apparently contradictory levels at the
         same time. Thus one can speak of God as spirit and at the same time imagine "him"
         as
         belonging to the male sex. Such primitive images can profoundly affect
         conceptualizations which appear to be very refined and abstract. Even the Yahwch of
         the future, so cherished by the theology of hope, comes through on an imaginative
         level as exclusively a He-God, and it is perhaps consistent with this that
         theologians of hope have attempted to develop a political theology which takes no
         explicit cognizance of the devastation wrought by sexual politics. The widespread
         conception of the "Supreme Being" as an entity distinct from this world but
         controlling it according to plan and keeping human beings in a state of infantile
         subjection has been a not too subtle mask of the divine patriarch. The Supreme
         Being's plausibility, and that of the static worldview which accompanies this
         projection has, of course, declined. This was a projection grounded in specifically
         patriarchal infrastructures and sustained as subjectively real by the usual
         processes of generating plausibility. The sustaining power of the social
         infrastructures has been eroded by a number of developments in recent history,
         including the general trend toward democratization of society and the emergence of
         technology with the accompanying sense of mastery over' the world and man's destiny.
         However, it is the women's movement which appears destined to play the key-role in
         the overthrow of such oppressive elements in traditional theism, precisely because
         it strikes at the source of the imbalance reflected in traditional beliefs. 
         The women's movement will present a growing threat to patriarchal
         religion less by attacking it than by simply leaving it behind. Few of the leaders
         in the movement evince an interest in institutional religion, having recognized it
         as an instrument of their betrayal. Those who see their commitment to the movement
         as consonant with concern for the religious heritage are aware that the Christian
         tradition is by no means bereft of elements which foster genuine experiences and
         intimations of transcendence. The problem is that their liberating potential is
         choked off in the surrounding atmosphere of the images, ideas, values, and
         structures of patriarchy. What will, I think, become possible through the social
         change coming from radical feminism is a more acute and widespread perception of
         qualitative differences between those conceptualizations of God and of the human
         relationship to God which are oppressive in their implications, and those which
         encourage self-actualization and social commitment.
         </p>
      
      <p> The various theologies that hypostatize transcendence
         invariably use this "God" to legitimate oppression, particularly that of women.
         These are irredeemably anti- feminine and therefore anti-human. In contrast to this,
         a more authentic language of transcendence does not hypostatize or objectify God and
         consequently does not lend itself to such use. So for example, Tillich's way of
         speaking about God as ground and power of being would be very difficult to use for
         the legitimation of any sort of oppression. It grows out of awareness of that
         reality which is both transcendent and immanent, not reducible to or adequately
         represented by such expressions as person, father, supreme being. Awareness of this
         reality is not achieved by playing theological games but by existential courage. I
         am not saying that a liberated consciousness necessarily will use Tillich's language
         of transcendence. That of Whitehead, James, Jaspers, to mention a few—or an entirely
         new language—may do as well or better. But it remains true that the driving
         revelatory force which will make possible an authenticity of religious consciousness
         is courage in the face of anxiety. </p>
      
      <p>Since the projections of patriarchal religion have been
         blocking the dynamics of existential courage by otlering the false security of
         alienation—that is, of self-reduction to stereotyped roles—there is reason to see
         hope for the emergence of genuine religious consciousness in the massive challenge
         to patriarchy which is now in its initial stages. The becoming of women may be not
         only the doorway to deliverance from the omnipotent Father in all of his disguises—a
         deliverance which secular humanism has passionately fought for—but also a doorway
         to
         something, that is, the beginning for many of a more authentic search for
         transcendence, that is, for God.</p>
      
      <p> The imbalance in Christian ideology resulting from sexual
         hierarchy is manifested not only in the doctrine of God but also in the notion of
         Jesus as the unique God-man. A great deal of Christian doctrine"concerning Jesus has
         been docetic, that is, it has not really seriously accepted the fact that Jesus was
         a human being. An effect of the liberation of women will very likely be the loss of
         plausibility of Christological formulas which come close to reflecting a kind of
         idolatry in regard to the person of Jesus. As it becomes better understood that God
         is transcendent and unobjcctifiable—or else not at all— it will become less
         plausible to speak of Jesus as the Second Person of the Trinity who "assumed" a
         human nature. Indeed, the prevalent emphasis upon the total uniqueness and
         supereminence of Jesus will, I think, become less meaningful. To say this is not at
         all to deny his extraordinary character and mission. The point is to attempt a
         realistic assessment of certain ways of using his image (which in all likelihood he
         himself would repudiate). It is still not uncommon for priests and ministers, when
         confronted with the issue of women's liberation, to assert that God become incarnate
         uniquely as a male, and then to draw arguments for male supremacy from this. Indeed,
         the tradition itself tends to justify such assertions. The underlying—and often
         explicit—assumption in the minds of theologians down through the centuries has been
         that the divinity could not have deigned to become incarnate in the "inferior" sex,
         and the "fact" that "he" did not do so reinforces the belief in masculine
         superiority/ The transformation of society by the erosion of male dominance will
         generate serious challenges to such assumptions of the Christological tradition.
         </p>
      
      <p>It will, I think, become increasingly evident that exclusively
         masculine symbols for the ideal of "incarnation" will not do. As a uniquely
         masculine divinity loses credibility, so also the idea of a unique divine
         incarnation in a human being of the male sex may give way in the religious
         consciousness to an increased awareness of the divine presence in all human beings,
         understood as expressing and in a real sense incarnating—although always
         inadequately—the power of being. The seeds of this awareness are already present,
         of
         course, in the traditional doctrine that all human beings are made to the image of
         God and in a less than adequate way in the doctrine of grace. Now it should become
         possible to work out with increasing realism the implication in both of these
         doctrines that human beings are called to self-actualization and to the creation of
         a community that fosters the becoming of women and men. This means that no
         completely adequate models can be taken from the past. It may be that we will
         witness a re- mythologizing of Western religion. Certainly, if the need for parental
         symbols for God persists, something like the Father-Mother God proposed by Mary
         Baker Eddy will be more acceptable to the new woman and the new man than the Father
         God of the past. A symbolism for incarnation of the divine in human beings may
         continue to be needed in the future, but it is highly unlikely that women or men
         will continue to find plausible that symbolism which is epitomized in the image of
         the Virgin kneeling in adoration before her own son. Perhaps this will be replaced
         by the emergence t of bisexual imagery which is not hierarchical. The experience of
         the past brought forth a new Adam and a new Eve. Perhaps the future will bring a new
         Christ and a new Mary. For the present, it would appear that we arc being called
         upon to recognize the poverty of all symbols and the fact of our past idolatry
         regarding them, and to turn to our own resources for bringing about the radically
         new in our own lives. </p>
      
      <p>The manifestation of God in Jesus was an cschato- logical event
         whose fulfilled reality lies in the future. The Jesus of the Gospels was a free
         person who challenged ossified beliefs and laws. Since he was remarkably free of
         prejudice against women and treated them as equals insofar as the limitations of his
         culture 'would allow, it is certain that he would be working with them for their
         liberation today. This awakening of women to their human potentiality by creative
         action as they assume equal partnership with men in society can bring about a
         manifestation of God in themselves which will be the Second Coming of God incarnate,
         fulfilling the latent promise in the original revelation that men and women are made
         to the image of God. </p>
      Behind the Mask 
      
      <p>It should be evident, then, that women's liberation is an event
         that can challenge authoritarian, exclusive and non-existential notions of faith and
         revelation. Since women have been extra-environmentals, to use a McLuhanish term,
         that is, since they have not been part of the authority structure which uses "faith"
         and "revelation" to reinforce the mechanisms of alienation, their emergence can
         effect a more widespread critical- ness of idolatry which is often masked by these
         ideas. There could result from this a more general understanding of faith as a state
         of ultimate concern and commitment and a heightened sense of relativity concerning
         the symbols it uses to express this commitment. An awareness might also emerge—not
         merely in the minds of a theological elite, but in the general con sciousness—that
         revelation is an ongoing experience. </p>
      
      <p>The becoming of women implies also a transvaluation of values
         in Christian morality. As the old order is challenged and as men and women become
         freed to experience a wholeness of personality which the old polarizations impeded,
         the potentiality will be awakened for a change in moral consciousness which will go
         far beyond Nietzsche's merely reactionary rejection of Christian values.</p>
      
      <p> Much of the traditional theory of Christian virtue appears to
         be the product of reactions on the part of men —perhaps guilty reactions—to the
         behavioral excesses of the stereotypic male. There has been theoretical emphasis
         upon charity, meekness, obedience, humility, self- abnegation, sacrifice, service.
         Part of the problem with this moral ideology is that it became generally accepted
         not by men but by women, who have hardly been helped by an ethic which reinforced
         their abject situation. This emphasis upon the passive virtues, of course, has not
         challenged exploitativeness but supported it. Part of the syndrome is the prevailing
         notion of sin as an offense against those in power, or against "God" (the two are
         often equated). Within the perspective of such a privatized morality the structures
         themselves of op- ' pression arc not seen as sinful.</p>
      
      <p>Consistent with all of this is the fact that the traditional
         Christian moral consciousness has been fixated upon the problems of reproductive
         activity in a manner totally disproportionate to its feeble political concern. This
         was summed up several years ago in Archbishop Roberts' remark that • "if
         contraceptives had been dropped over Japan instead of bombs which merely killed,
         maimed and shriveled up thousands alive there would have been a squeal of outraged
         protest from the Vatican to the remotest Mass center in Asia." Pertinent also is
         Simone de Beauvoir's remark that the church has reserved its uncompromising
         humanitarian- ism for man in the fetal condition. Although theologians today
         acknowledge that this privatized morality has failed to cope with the structures of
         oppression, few seriously face the possibility that the roots of this distortion are
         deeply buried in the fundamental and all- pervasive sexual alienation which the
         women's movement is seeking to overcome.</p>
      
      <p> It is well-known that Christians under the spell of the
         jealous God who represents the coliective power of his chosen people can use
         religion to justify that "us and them" attitude which is disastrous in its
         consequences for the powerless. It is less widely understood that the projection of
         "the other"—easily adaptable to national, racial and class differences—has basically
         and primordially been directed against women. Even the rhetoric of racism finds its
         model in sexism.</p>
      
      
      <p> The consciousness-raising which is beginning among women is
         evoking a qualitatively new understanding of the subtle mechanisms which produce and
         destroy "the other," and a consequent empathy with all of the oppressed. This gives
         grounds for the hope that their emergence can generate a counterforce to the
         exploitative mentality which is destroying persons and the environment. Since the
         way men and women are seen in society is a prime determinant in the whole social
         system and ideology, radical women refuse to see their movement as simply one among
         others. What I am suggesting is that it might be the only chance for the turning of
         human beings from a course leading to the deterioration and perhaps the end of life
         on this planet.</p>
      
      <p> Those who see their concern for women's liberation as
         consonant with an evolving Christianity would be unrealistic to expect much
         comprehension from the majority of male ecclesiastics. Such writers as Gordon
         Rattrey Taylor (The Biological Time Bomb), Robert Francoeur (Utopian Motherhood),
         and others ke«p beeping out the message that we are moving into a world in which
         human sexuality is no longer merely oriented to reproduction of the species—which
         means that the masculine and feminine mystiques are doomed to evaporate. Within the
         theological community, however, the predictable and almost universal response has
         been what one might call the ostrich syndrome. Whereas the old theology justified
         sexual oppression, the new theology for the most part simply ignores it and goes on
         in comfortable compatibility with it, failing to recognize its deep connection with
         such other major problems as war, racism and environmental pollution. The work of
         fostering religious consciousness which is explicitly incompatible with sexism will
         require an extraordinary degree of creative rage, love and hope.</p>
