        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
       <h4>First Wave Analysis</h4>
       <h4>Second Wave Analysis</h4>
       <h4>Third Wave Analysis</h4>
       <p>The excerpt from Punk Planet 29, as referenced before, centers on women in the realm of rock music. The original text in the archive of the magazine is displayed in interview format. For the “structure” element, the researchers separated the block of text at  each break into paragraphs. Instances of identity elements in the annotations center on gender specifically: “Men in Rock,” “the cliche of the girl keyboard player in the mini skirt,” and “women who play music.” These orientations of gender are strictly binary, which is a significant consideration once the researchers consider how feminist theory is incorporated in the dialogue of the interview. In the interview, there is a clear overarching wage in social power systems between rock music and mainstream music. The girls of Sleater-Kinney operate within the social sphere of rock music. Patriarchy, an additional power system, has norms that operate within this sphere. Members of the band, specifically Carrie, express their reaction to the power system of patriarchy by stating that they do not wish to be a part of the history of men in rock. In itself, this statement sounds feminist. The researchers theorize that the feminist theories that motivate this desire may be rooted in trans-exclusionary radical feminism due to her preceding statements that criticize consumers/critics who “think they’re paying [the group] a compliment by taking [them] out of the ‘girl group ghetto’ and saying [they’ve] transcended gender.” Carrie further inquires, “how could [the girl group] possibly transcend something that’s so experiential and part of who [they] are?” This can be speculated as rooted in trans-exclusionary radical feminist ideology, not only because Carrie does not clarify how she defines gender, but also fosters a stigmatizing attitude towards the transcendence of gender.</p>
         <p> The excerpt from Punk Planet 52 is structured in paragraphs in its original form, and therefore each block of text is categorized as in the “paragraph” attribute of the “structure” element. Instances of identity elements with the attribute of gender depict males and females within the visual aesthetic of early Y2K punk/goth. The feminist theories at work in this text are radically feminist. The production and consumption of pornography in the age of internet porn has been engulfed by large corporate offices that, according to the annotations made in this text, are rooted in class consumption. In plain terms, in order to access exclusive pornography in the age of the internet, you must bring money to the table. This is less common in porn produced by big studios. There is one instance of the class element appearing in these annotations, and that is the mention of the “DIY” element that punk porn brings to the table. Punk porn creators often offer free pictures, which the researchers classified the mention of “free” as an economic attribute of the class structure. However, this same attribute is clarified further in an earlier part of the text through the statement that “if [one] wants to see more, [they] better get out [their] credit card.” The sexuality attribute of the identity element aims not only to classify certain types of sex mentioned in this excerpt, but also to group descriptions of images of the sexual body together in order to create a portrait of the aesthetic of the content of this type of pornography depicted in punk porn. An important limitation of the researcher to consider is the fact that some scholars may argue that pornography is anti-feminist, while some scholars think it is best classified through theories of radical feminism. Some radical feminisms despise pornography, and this is one of the only areas where they agree with anti-feminists.</p>        
         <p> The excerpt from Punk Planet 62 mainly grapples with the power system of patriarchy in specific regard to consent. The concept of “blue balls” is an inherently patriarchal one, and is referenced as “nothing more than a sad excuse for guys to pressure girls into having sex.” This sense of coercion that is often inflicted on women drove the author to start exercising political lesbianism, which is a feminist theory outlined in the schema. The researchers utilized the identity element and the sexuality attributes to categorize words that reference genitalia and motions of sex, such as the orgasm or the act of masturbating. The excerpt is largely a discussion of what physically happens in the male body during “blue balls,” in order to express the fact that the only process taking place in the biological male body is increased blood flow to the genitals. Joking about the term “purple pussy’ is a decision by the author that can be classified as a radical feminist ideology in the feminist theory attribute. What makes the play on words with “purple pussy” juxtaposed to the common phrase “blue balls” so radical is the fact that this same process of increased blood flow to genitals occurs in the female body as well upon reaching orgasm. However, it can be argued that this explanation has gender essentialist undertones because not all women have bodies that are biologically female, and they do not experience the sensation of increased blood flow in the biological female body. Discussions of how the patriarchal and coercive concept of “blue balls” is strictly limited to how cisgender women are affected, with specific biologically essentialist references to sexual identity.</p>
