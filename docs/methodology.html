        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <div class="box"><p> Our project aims to compare the Four Waves of Western Feminism through their media, to gain insight into
            who is considered a part of each movement, what issues are considered a focus, and how
            each author defines their identity. </p>
        <p> We compared each text's mentions of 
            <strong>power systems</strong> such as patriarchy;
            <strong>religion</strong>, whether personal or as a critique; 
            socioeconomic <strong>class</strong>; 
            author or subject <strong>identity</strong> such as nationality and sexuality; 
            <strong>feminist theories</strong> such as political lesbianism or marxist feminism; and
            <strong>social theories</strong> such as Fruedian
            analysis or the Enlightenment individualism. </p>
        <p>
         These are our primary loci of comparison.</div>
