        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p class= "narrow"> The curated schema that ties the different waves of feminism (as well as the texts
                assigned per wave) together is the baseline for the research conducted on these
                movements. 
            <p class= "narrow">The schema’s <b>meta</b> element grapples with the text’s origin and authorship.
                To create a well-formed XML document, each text annotation needed to include text
                sorted in the author attribute, the title attribute, the source attribute, and the
                publication date. In that order. This part of the annotation process is vital
                because it provides specific insight into when in the feminist movement the text was
                produced, who in the movement produced it, who in the movement published it, and
                what topic in the movement the text discusses. </p>
            <p class= "narrow">There are <b>nine additional elements</b>
                the researchers utilised in the text annotation process utilizing the Oxygen
                software. These elements include “<b>power system</b>,” “<b>intersection</b>,” “<b>identity</b>,”
                “<b>religion</b>,” “<b>class</b>,” “<b>structure</b>,” “<b>f_theory</b>,” “<b>s_theory</b>,” and “<b>setting</b>.” All of
                these elements serve a specific purpose in drawing conclusions in the research being
                conducted. It categorizes the nine individual viewpoints the researchers take in
                examining historical texts. </p>
            <p class= "narrow"> The “<b>power system</b>” element is the parent element of
                seven attributes. These attributes include “<b>p_patriarchy</b>,” <b>“p_religion</b>,” “<b>p_class</b>,”
                “<b>p_race</b>,” “<b>p_political</b>,” “<b>p_social</b>,” and “<b>p_matriarchy</b>.” The researchers attach this
                element with instances in which power systems are referenced or incorporated in the
                texts. Types of power systems give the researchers/readers insight into the type of
                oppression discussed/enforced in each text.</p> 
            <p class= "narrow">The “<b>religion</b>” element is the parent
                element of ten attributes. These attributes include “<b>r_non_western</b>,” “<b>r_islam</b>,”
                “<b>r_protestentism</b>” “<b>r_catholicism</b>,” “<b>r_judaism</b>,” “<b>r_indigenous</b>,” “<b>r_christianity</b>,”
                “<b>r_greekmyth</b>,” “<b>r_quaker</b>,” and “<b>r_anglican</b>.” Religion also shows up as an attribute
                of the power system. It is an element as well that serves to properly distinguish
                how different religious philosophies/practices differ across belief systems. </p>
            <p class= "narrow"> The
                “<b>class</b>” element is the parent element of seven attributes. These attributes include
                “<b>social</b>,” “<b>political</b>,” “<b>economic</b>,” “<b>working_class</b>,” “<b>wealthy</b>,” “<b>middle</b>,” and
                “<b>lower</b>.” Even though class is also a power system, this element serves as a specific
                element that analyzes what tier of class is being analyzed. It also considers the
                type of class conflicts that exist, both economic and political. </p>
            <p class= "narrow">The “<b>intersection</b>”
                element exists without any children in the schema. This element, even though the
                specifications are limitated, grapples with the concept of intersectionality
                pioneered by Kimberlé Crenshaw. It is utilized by the researchers in instances where
                the concept of intersectional feminism can be discussed. The “identity” element is
                the parent element of four attributes. These attributes include “<b>race</b>,” “<b>sexuality</b>,”
                “<b>gender</b>,” and “<b>nationality</b>.” In this breath, intersectionality can be broken down to
                its core parts. People are a mosaic of their social identities assigned to them, and
                they all play a part in how ideologies of feminism operate. The “setting” element
                exists without any children in the schema. This element is used to categorize where
                a text is produced.</p> 
            <p class= "narrow">The “<b>f_theory</b>” element is the parent element of nine attributes.
                These attributes include “<b>f_marxist</b>,” “<b>f_rad_fem</b>,” “<b>f_terf</b>,” “<b>f_liberal</b>,”
                “<b>f_praxis</b>,” “<b>f_antifeminist</b>,” “<b>f_political_lesbian</b>,” “<b>f_abolitionist</b>,” and
                “<b>f_enlightenment_individualism</b>.” This portion of the schema brings in a system of
                how to organize the discussion on specific feminist ideologies. </p>
            <p class= "narrow">The “<b>s_theory</b>”
                element is the parent element of four attributes. These attributes include
                “<b>s_freud</b>,” “<b>s_right_of_man</b>,” “<b>s_enlightenment</b>,” and “<b>s_natural_rights</b>.” This portion
                of the schema deals with how four different social ideologies operate in the
                assessed texts. </p>
            <p class= "narrow">The “<b>structure</b>” element is the parent element of fourteen
                attributes. It deals mainly with how the original text is structured. It is a line
                of code that also structures the text and its syntax accordingly when its appearance
                is translated on the website. This is important because for the research findings to
                have the most clarity, a characteristic that needs to be respected and adhered to at
                its core is how the original text is structured by the author and publisher. The
                attributes in this element include “<b>q</b>” (quote), “<b>cap</b>” (caption), “<b>p</b>” (paragraph),
                “<b>c</b>,” (chapter), “<b>l</b>” (line), “<b>s</b>” (stanza), “<b>page</b>” (page), “<b>po</b>” (poem), “<b>le</b>” (letter),
                “<b>date</b>” (date), “<b>fnote</b>,” (footnote), “<b>header</b>” (header), “<b>subhead</b>” (subheading), and
                “<b>sig</b>” (signature).</p>
