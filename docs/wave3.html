                    All of the texts below deal with issues present in
                    the third wave of feminism, but this issues still persist in the fourth wave.
                    Punk Planet 29 is an interview between Dan Sinker and the members of the
                    American rock band Sleater-Kinney. The text brings in the discussion of how
                    feminist theory and class systems operate in the music world in the 1990s. In
                    these excerpts, the researchers identify arguments for trans-exclusionary
                    radical feminist ideology, gender roles in American rock music, and how certain
                    social structures within mainstream music are separate from those that reign in
                    rock music. There is also room to argue that the band’s motives in separating
                    themselves from their male contemporaries. However, certain expressions from
                    this interview leave room for potential criticism of their belief systems. Punk
                    Planet 52 considers the role of pornography in feminism. It advocates for the
                    production of punk pornography, which is different from preexisting arguably
                    more oppressive forms of internet pornography that is organized from a corporate
                    boardroom. This itself is waging power systems in regard to class. The concept
                    of “punk porn” is classified as a radical feminist one. However, this
                    classification varies feminist-by-feminist. Pornography is an issue that
                    connects the ideologies of some anti-feminists and radical feminists. It is
                    important to note that this specific issue is not covered in these annotations.
                    Punk Planet 62 grapples with questions about consent, the sexual encounter, and
                    orgasm. Mentions of reproductive organs and the motions of sexual encounters are
                    categorized by identity; however, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to note that these
                    identity markups are purely one of sexuality and not gender. Slang for certain
                    reproductive organs, in the fourth wave, can be applied to organs they are not
                    traditionally associated with in gender essentialist terms. “Blue balls” is
                    deemed a patriarchal concept that aims to force women into sexual submission to
                    men. “Purple pussy” is a term that flips “blue balls” upside down — a radical
                    feminist reading on the increased blood flow to the genitals but no result in
                    FEMALE ORGASM. . </p>
