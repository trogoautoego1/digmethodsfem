            <p>Welcome to our project, <strong>Feminist Media Throughout History</strong>. <br />
                <br /> Our goal through this research is to understand how depictions of women and
                feminism in popular or prominent feminist texts develop alternative focuses over the
                course of the 19th to 21st century.</p>

                studying Ecology &amp; Evolution and English Literature through a double major, with

                ideaologies of nature/humanity; they consider queer and feminist theory a hobby. Maya focused on first-wave feminist texts. </p>
            <h3> Megan </h3>
            <p> Megan Barron is a Sophmore at the University of Pittsburgh studying Film and Media Analysis with
                an interest in a non-fiction writing minor. Her studies often focus on viewing film and visual imagery through
                the lens of feminism and queer theory, researching the complicated and interconnected relationship between gender and
                cinema. Their interest in feminism began through classes in the Gender, Sexuality, and Women's Studies department and expanded
                to a personal hobby and political identity.
