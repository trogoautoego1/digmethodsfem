                <h2>Second Wave Feminism</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Second-wave feminism is usually defined as lasting from the 1960s to the 1980s.
                    The beginning of this wave is often defined by the publishing of The Feminine
                    Mystique by Betty Friedan. In the first wave, women were mostly fighting for
                    legal rights such as the right to vote. In this second wave the scope of the
                    feminist movement broadened to include issues such as reproductive rights,
                    sexuality and domestic violence. As in the first wave, white feminists mostly
                    dominated the mainstream, although they began to speak more about topics such as
                    class, middle and upper class women were still much more prevalent writers. </p>
