                <h2>First Wave Feminism</h2>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p> First-wave feminism was a period of groundwork in the ‘western’ world, marked by
                    women’s advocacy for their own political and philosophical equality. </p>
                <p> The Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 is widely considered the formal ‘start date’
                    for the first wave of feminism, though the work and conversations of women in
                    the earlier decades of the 19th century formed the basis for such a convention
                    to be held. One of the earliest formal feminist propositions was A Vindication
                    of the Rights of Women by Mary Wollstonecraft, published in 1792– nearly 50
                    years prior to the formal beginning of the first wave. </p>
                    <p> Sarah Grimke wrote her
                    <em>Letters on the Equality of the Sexes</em> in 1837, during the buildup to widespread organized
                    women’s rights movements. Arguably, the thoughts discussed directly before
                    history’s most influential events can illuminate the zeitgeist just as well as,
                    if not better than, the propaganda formed after a meeting of the minds. Grimke
                    was a prominent abolitionist as well as a feminist, and argued in favor of
                    complete equality in social standing regardless of sex (though her depiction of
                    the sexes was particularly binary, and based in her Quaker faith). Despite her
                    and many others first-wave feminists’ stances as abolitionists, the movement as
                    a whole is characterized as centering around the rights of white, western women
                    in particular. Letters gives insight into the arguments made by white
                    abolitionist-feminists about other people, in the context of their own
                    worldview. A selection of letters were sourced from Grimke’s collection, in an
                    attempt to abbreviate her points about . </p>
