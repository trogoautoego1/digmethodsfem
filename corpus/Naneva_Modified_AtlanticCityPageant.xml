    <main> "Women of the World Unite-We Have Nothing to Lose But Our Men!" Off hand, I'd say that's
        quite a lot. Not so, however, according to New York Women's Liberation, who last Saturday,
        September 7 staged a demonstration on Atlantic City's boardwalk to protest the crowning of
        Miss America 1968, "symbol of the American woman's built-in obsolescence." The demonstration
        began at 3:00 in the afternoon in front of the Atlantic City Convention Hall. Women's
        Liberation, its participants numbering around 200, began with a march, interrupted almost
        immediately by <power_system p_political="police">police vigilance</power_system>, hecklers
        and Pageant organizers. Placards read "Miss America is alive and angry in Harlem," "Welcome
        to the <power_system p_patriarchy="patriarchy">Miss America Cattle Auction</power_system>,"
        and "Everyone is beautiful," while demonstrators chanted, "Atlantic City is a town with
        class, they raise your morals and judge Hecklers on the other side of the police barricades
        retorted with "Do you play around with monkeys or men?" and "You wouldn't even make it in a
        woman's world." Although the majority of the spectators were hostile, one middle-aged man
        commented, "I think there's some truth, some factuality in their arguments." Jeers ranged
        from "<identity sexuality="lesbian">lesbians></identity>" and "screwy frustrated women" to
            <power_system p_patriarchy="patriarchy">"If they were to get married, they wouldn't have
            time for all this," </power_system> (many of Women's Liberation are married) and "If
        they want freedom, let them join the Service." A little group set up its own counter-
        demonstration, with posters of "Jealousy will get you nowhere." Terry Neeuwsen, Miss Green
        Bay 1967 and runner-up number two in the 1967 Pageant, emerged from the crowd wearing a
        sign, "There's only one thing wrong with Miss America-she's beautiful." Fuzzy Technicality
        The action really began later in the afternoon when one of Women's Liberation lead a little
        wooly lamb onto the boardwalk, with a blue-and-yellow Miss America banner draped on its
        back. The lamb trotted along amicably, but even the big bow judiciously strapped to its tail
        couldn't hide the fact that Women's Liberation Miss America 1968 was a male, and on
        discovery of this fact the crowd hooted and roared. Robin Morgan, organizer of the
        demonstration, attired the lamb in a black padded bra and hair-switch. Then came a huge
        Freedom Trash Can, into which Women's Liberation dropped items of its purported
        enslavement-bras, stockings, girdles, hair-curlers, copies of Vogue, Cosmopolitan and
        Ladies' Home Journal. Even the lamb was divested of its garb and let loose to wander in its
        original state. Next came an eight-foot wooden puppet with movable joints who looked like
        the female version of-' Uncle Sam, and had chained to it several girls who were "auctioned
        off by Peggy Dobbins, dressed in a grey oversized man's coat, big rubbers, tie, trousers and
        a white <power_system p_race="black">slave trader's hat</power_system>, to represent an
            <power_system p_race="slavery">"auctioneer slave-trader."</power_system> She gave a
        dialogue on the rights of women in much the same manner as that of the original
        suffragettes, after whom Women's Liberation seems to model itself. The demonstration's ranks
        dwindled a little at suppertime when girls went to eat at a <identity race="black">Black
            Community open-house</identity> arranged by Flo Ken- The Pageant itself began at 8:30
        with contestants nervously strutting along the platform and a diligent contingent of
            <power_system p_political="police">policewomen</power_system>, troopers and
        plainclothesmen following around the 16 or so members of the Women's Liberation who had
        tickets for the ceremony. Around 10:30 a very peculiar odor started to permeate the main
        room and corridors of the Convention Hall and obviously wafted its way to the noses of
        police who arrested Peggy Dobbins as she . came down the Pageant room steps spraying a Toni
        hair-spray bottle filled with butric acid. The Pageant continued with the contestants doing
        their routines, reminiscent of a Saturday afternoon talent show for 12- year-olds. *
        Eighteen-year-old Judith Ann Ford, Miss Illinois, was crowned Miss America at 12:00
        midnight. She hadn't uttered three words of her acceptance speech, when a burst of "Down
        with Miss America," "Freedom" and "Women's Liberation" echoed from the right wing of the
        Convention Hall balcony. A large white bedsheet with the words "Women's Liberation" had been
        hung over the balcony railing in full view. Police on the Convention floor brandishing
        billyclubs ran up the stairs to the balcony section and carried away the six girls who had
        lowered the banner. One girl who was slow in moving was carried off with a policeman's hand
        around her throat and another hand over her mouth. "They're expressing freedom, I guess,"
        remarked Saundra Williams, 19-year-old winner of the <identity race="black">Miss Black
            America Beauty Pageant</identity>, the first of its kind, held the same day in Atlantic
        City on the boardwalk. "To each his own." The demonstration outside the Convention Hall,
        which was continuing with a candlelight vigil, was ordered to disperse and "escorted" down
        the boardwalk by Atlantic City police and jeering Pageant participants. The group, after
        some delay and much harassment, finally boarded a city bus and was taken to a terminal on
        the outskirts of town to await its own chartered bus. It was learned meanwhile that Peggy
        Dobbins had been charged with disorderly conduct on a $1,000 bail and the girls who had
        lowered the banner with $110 each. Officials of the group then went to the centra] police
        station where, through the arrangements of Flo Kennedy and a Philadelphia woman lawyer who
        had taken up the cause on the boardwalk, bail for Peggy was reduced to $110 and $50 each for
        the six other girls. Commented Paul Krassner of the Realist who despite his sex was very
        helpful in retrieving lost articles for the girls and who seemed very much the topic of
        conversation for the new suffragettes on the way home, "<power_system p_political="politics"
