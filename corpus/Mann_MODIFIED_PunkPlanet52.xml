        <structure p="paragraph">Posing is easy, says Hannah. By the end of her first photo shoot, she was trashed on whiskey ("it kinda settled my 
            nerves,” she laughs) and hav¬ing a blast. And then she was naked. And then pretty soon afterward, she was naked on the Internet at Friction USA, one of a wave of <f_theory f_liberal="adult websites">adult websites</f_theory> 
            selling what’s basically—though no one wants to put it so <f_theory f_rad_fem ="bluntly—punk rock porn.">bluntly—punk rock porn.</f_theory></structure>
        
        <structure p="paragraph"><identity gender="Women">Women</identity> like Hannah—not her real name—are where the action is on sites like Friction USA, Burning Auigel, and leaderof-the-pack Suicide Girls. 
            The sites rack up a reported tens of thousands of visitors a day, charging members a few bucks a month to see thousands of crystal-clear color photos of what 
            Suicide Girls call "<identity gender="the hottest, cutest, sexiest goth, punk, and emo girls we can find">the hottest, cutest, sexiest goth, punk, and emo girls we can find</identity>.” 
            And after only one year, these <identity gender="girls with pretty good hair and not-always-so-good-but-hey-we-all-liked-the-Misfitsat-one-time-too-right">girls with pretty good hair and not-always-so-good-but-hey-we-all-liked-the-Misfitsat-one-time-too-right</identity>? 
            tattoos have won more of an audience than Punk Planet or pretty much any little dirtball

            <f_theory f_rad_fem="Punk">Punk</f_theory> has a new face now: probably young, <identity race="probably white">probably white</identity>, and probably topless, and <class economic="if you wanna see more, you bet¬ ter get out your credit card.">if you wanna see more, you bet¬ ter get out your credit card.</class> And, says

        <structure p="paragraph">Nobody’s started stalking her; nobody’s sending her creepy emails. About the most uncomfortable thing that happened was one of her 
            co-workers gingerly asking, "So, I hear you’re on a . . . web¬ site.” And even that, she says, was no big deal.</structure>
        
        <structure p="paragraph">"People think it’s totally like <f_theory f_rad_fem="porno">porno</f_theory>, like <identity sexuality="guys on girls">guys on girls</identity>, and it’s not really like that,” Hannah says. "It’s not all about, 
            'Oh, there are your <identity sexuality="tits">tits</identity>!’ If you’re not comfortable with something, you don’t have to do it—and having it out in public is no big deal. <f_theory f_rad_fem="It’s more

            <structure p="paragraph">"It’d be really funny,” she says. "Better than them cutting ads out of Victoria’s Secret catalogs.”</structure>
            
        <structure p="paragraph">So welcome to <f_theory f_rad_fem="punk porn">punk porn</f_theory>, the alternative to Hustler, Barely Legal and poor old obsolete Victoria’s Secret: whether they’re peddling 
            erotica, smut, or just old-fashioned pin-up-style T&amp;A, a wave of websites like Friction USA, Burning Angel, and Suicide Girls have carved out a cozy 
            little spot in the punk consciousness, playing upstart little sister to a swollen adult-amateur industry and <f_theory f_rad_fem="bring¬ ing punk style and— maybe —substance to

                who wouldn’t put a zine called Probe out on the record-store shelves IO years ago because it had a series of <identity sexuality="black-and-white boob shots">black-and-white boob shots</identity>— aren’t even getting

        <structure p="paragraph">Right now, this <f_theory f_rad_fem="punk porn">punk porn</f_theory> thing feels pretty good—way better than stroking it to Belle and Sebastian record covers. Punk and porn 
            have had a strangely uneasy relationship for years, but the chemistry—and <power_system p_class="the money—is apparently finally there">the money—is apparently finally there</power_system>. And as everyone’s websites strut toward 
            their one-year anniversaries, there’s still an almost-idealistic sense of innocence: it’s fun, it’s cute, it’s clean, <identity sexuality="it's sexy">it’s sexy</identity>, it’s <class economic="DIY">DIY</class>, and it’s not 
                hurting anyone, right? Then why does it feel like no one’s thought about the hard parts—well, besides those hard parts—yet?</structure>
