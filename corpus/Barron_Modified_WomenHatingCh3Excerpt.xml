        The Story of O, by Pauline Reage, incorporates, along with all literary pornography, principles 
        and characters already isolated in my discussion of children's fairy tales. The <identity gender="female">female</identity> as a 
        figure of innocence and evil enters the adult world--the brutal world of genitalia. The <identity gender="female">female </identity>
        manifests in her adult form--cunt. She emerges defined by the hole between her legs. In 
        addition, Story of O is more than simple pornography. <f_theory f_antifeminist="epistemological">It claims to define epistemologically 
            what a woman is, what she needs, her processes of thinking and feeling, her proper place.</f_theory> It 
        links men and women in an erotic dance of some magnitude: the sado-masochistic 
        complexion of O is not trivial--<f_theory f_antifeminist="natural basis">it is formulated as a cosmic principle which articulates, 
            absolutely, the feminine.</f_theory>
        </structure>
        <structure p="2">
        Also, O is particularly compelling for me because I once believed it to be what its defenders 
        claim--the mystical revelation of the true, eternal, and sacral destiny of <identity>women</identity>. The book 
            was absorbed as a pulsating, erotic, <religion r_christianity="compares to christianity">secular Christianity</religion> (the joy in pure suffering, woman as 
        Christ figure). I experienced O with the same infantile abandon as the NEWSWEEK reviewer 
        who wrote: "What lifts this fascinating book above mere perversity is its movement toward 
        the transcendence of the self through a gift of the self . . . to give the body, to allow it to be 
        ravaged, exploited, and totally possessed can be an act of consequence, if it is done with 
        love for the sake of love." <structure fnote="Newsweek, March 21, 1966, p. 108, unsigned.">1</structure> Any clear-headed appraisal of O will show the situation, O's 
        condition, her behavior, and most importantly her attitude toward her oppressor as a logical 
        scenario incorporating <religion r_judaism="Judeo-Christian">Judeo</religion>-<religion r_christianity="Judeo-Christian">Christian</religion> values of service and self-sacrifice and universal 
        notions of womanhood, <class social="all oppressed peoples">a logical scenario demonstrating the psychology of submission and 
        self-hatred found in all oppressed peoples</class>. O is a book of astounding political significance.
        </structure>
        <structure p="3">
        This is, then, the story of O: O is taken by her lover Rene to Roissy and cloistered there; she 
        is fucked, sucked, raped, whipped, humiliated, and tortured on a regular and continuing 
        basis--she is programmed to be an erotic slave, Rene's personal whore; after being properly 
        trained she is sent home with her lover; her lover gives her to Sir Stephen, his half-brother; 
        she is fucked, sucked, raped, whipped, humiliated, and tortured on a regular and continuing 
        basis; she is ordered to become the lover of Jacqueline and to recruit her for Roissy, which 
        she does; she is sent to Anne-Marie to be branded with Sir Stephen's mark and to have rings 
        with his insignia inserted in her cunt; she serves as an erotic model for Jacqueline's younger 
        sister Natalie who is infatuated with her; she is taken to a party masked as an owl, led on a 
        leash by Natalie, and there plundered, despoiled, raped, gangbanged; realizing that there is 
        nothing else left for Sir Stephen to do with her or to her, fearing that he will abandon her, she 
        asks his permission to kill herself and receives it. Q.E.D., pornography is never big on plot.
        </structure>
        <structure p="4">
        Of course, like most summaries, the above is somewhat sketchy. I have not mentioned the 
        quantities of cock that O sucks, or the anal assaults that she sustains, or the various rapes 
        and tortures perpetrated on her by minor characters in the book, or the varieties of whips 
        used, or described her clothing or the different kinds of nipple rouge, or the many ways in 
        which she is chained, or the shapes and colors of the welts on her body.
        </structure>
        <structure p="5"> 
        From the course of O's story emerges a clear mythological figure: <power_system p_patriarchy="submission of women">she is woman, and to name 
        her O, zero, emptiness, says it all. Her ideal state is one of complete passivity, nothingness, 
        a submission so absolute that she transcends human form</power_system> (in becoming an owl). Only the 
        hole between her legs is left to define her, and the symbol of that hole must surely be O. 
        Much, however, even in the rarefied environs of pornography, necessarily interferes with the 
        attainment of utter passivity. <f_theory f_enlightenment_individualism="women as an individual">Given a body which takes up space, has needs, makes 
        demands, is connected, even symbolically, to a personal history which is a sequence of 
        likes, dislikes, skills, opinions, one is formed, shaped--one exists at the very least as positive 
        space.</f_theory> And since in addition as a woman one is born guilty and carnal, personifying the sins 
        of <religion r_christianity="Adam and Eve">Eve</religion> and <religion r_greekmyth="Pandora's box">Pandora</religion>, the wickedness of <religion r_judaism="Queen of Israel">Jezebel</religion> and Lucretia Borgia, O's transcendence of the 
        species is truly phenomenal.
        </structure>
        <structure p="6">
        The thesis of O is simple. <power_system p_patriarchy="belief in natural sexuality and submission">Woman is cunt, lustful, wanton. She must be punished, tamed, 
        debased. She gives the gift of herself, her body, her well-being, her life, to her lover. This is as 
        it should be--natural and good.</power_system> It ends necessarily in her annihilation, which is also natural 
        and good, as well as beautiful, because she fulfills her destiny:
        </structure>
        <structure p="7">
        As long as I am beaten and ravished on your behalf, I am naught but the thought of you, the 
        desire of you, the obsession of you. That, I believe, is what you wanted. Well, I love you, and 
        that is what I want too. <structure fnote="Pauline Reage, Story of O (New York: Grove Press, 1965), p. xxi.">2</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="8">
        Then let him take her, if only to wound her! O hated herself for her own desire, and loathed 
        Sir Stephen for the self-control he was displaying. She wanted him to love her, there, the truth 
        was out: she wanted him to be chafing under the urge to touch her lips and penetrate her 
        body, to devastate her if need be. . . . <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 80.">3</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="9">
        . . . Yet he was certain that she was guilty and, without really wanting to, Rene was punishing 
        her for a sin he knew nothing about (since it remained completely internal), although Sir 
        Stephen had immediately detected it: her wantonness. <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 93.">4</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="10">
        . . . no pleasure, no joy, no figment of her imagination could ever compete with the happiness 
        she felt at the way he used her with such utter freedom, at the notion that he could do
        anything with her, that there was no limit, no restriction in the manner with which, on her 
        body, he might search for pleasure. <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 187.">5</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="11">
        O is totally possessed. That means that she is an object, with no control over her own 
        mobility, capable of no assertion of personality. Her body is a body, in the same way that a 
        pencil is a pencil, a bucket is a bucket, or, as Gertrude Stein pointedly said, a rose is a rose. 
        It also means that O's energy, or power, as a woman, as Woman, is absorbed. <power_system p_patriarchy=" biological and spiritual power transfer">Possession 
        here denotes a biological transference of power which brings with it a commensurate 
        spiritual strength to the possessor. O does more than offer herself; she is herself the offering.</power_system> 
        To offer herself would be <religion r_christianity="non-poetic sacrifice">prosaic Christian self-sacrifice</religion>, but as the offering she is the vehicle 
        of the miraculous--she incorporates the divine.
        </structure>
        <structure p="12">
        Here sacrifice has its ancient, primal meaning: that which was given at the beginning 
        becomes the gift. The first fruits of the harvest were dedicated to and consumed by the 
        vegetation spirit which provided them. The destruction of the victim in human or animal 
        sacrifice or the consumption of the offering was the very definition of the sacrifice--death 
        was necessary because the victim was or represented the life-giving substance, the vital 
        energy source, which had to be liberated, which only death could liberate. An actual death, 
        the sacrifice per se, not only liberated benevolent energy but also ensured a propagation and 
        increase of life energy (concretely expressed as fertility) by a sort of magical ecology, a 
        recycling of basic energy, or raw power. O's victimization is the confirmation of her power, a 
        power which is transcendental and which has as its essence the sacred processes of life, 
        death, and regeneration.
        </structure>
        <structure p="13">
        But the full significance of possession, both mystically and mythologically, is not yet clear. 
        In mystic experience communion (wrongly called possession sometimes) has meant the 
        dissolution of the ego, the entry into ecstasy, union with and illumination of the godhead. The 
        experience of communion has been the province of the mystic, prophet, or visionary, those 
        who were able to alchemize their energy into pure spirit and this spirit into a state of grace. 
        Possession, rightly defined, is the perversion of the mystic experience; it is by its very nature 
        demonic because its goal is power, its means are violence and oppression. It spills the blood 
        of its victim and in doing so estranges itself from life-giving union. O's lover thinks that she 
        gives herself freely but if she did not, he would take her anyway. Their relationship is the 
        incarnation of demonic possession:
        </structure>
        <structure p="14">
        Thus he would possess her as a god possesses his creatures, whom he lays hold of in the 
        guise of a monster or bird, of an invisible spirit or a state of ecstasy. He did not wish to leave 
        her. The more he surrendered her, the more he would hold her dear. <power_system p_patriarchy="ownership and control">The fact that he gave her 
        was to him a proof, and ought to be for her as well, that she belonged to him: one can only 
        give what belongs to you. He gave her only to reclaim her immediately, to reclaim her 
        enriched in his eyes, like some common object which had been used for some divine 
        purpose and has thus been consecrated. For a long time he had wanted to prostitute her, 
        and he was delighted to feel that the pleasure he was deriving was even greater than he had 
        hoped, and that it bound him to her all the more so because, through it, she would be more 
        humiliated and ravished. Since she loved him, she could not help loving whatever derived 
        from him.</power_system> <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 32.">6</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="15">
        <class working_class="sex work">A precise corollary of possession is prostitution. The prostitute, the woman as object, is 
        defined by the usage to which the possessor puts her. Her subjugation is the signet of his 
        power. Prostitution means for the woman the carnal annihilation of will and choice, but for 
        the man it once again signifies an increase in power, pure and simple.</class> To call the power of 
        the possessor, which he demonstrates by playing superpimp, divine, or to confuse it with 
        ecstasy or communion, is to grossly misunderstand. "All the mouths that had probed her 
        mouth, all the hands that had seized her breasts and belly, all the members that had been 
        thrust into her had so perfectly provided the living proof that she was worthy of being 
        prostituted and had, so to speak, sanctified her." <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 106.">7</structure> Of course, it is not O who is sanctified, 
        but Rene, or Sir Stephen, or the others, through her.
        </structure>
        <structure p="16">
        O's prostitution is a vicious caricature of old-world religious prostitution. The ancient sacral 
        prostitution of the <religion r_judaism="Jewish Prostitution">Hebrews</religion>, <religion r_greekmyth="Greek Prostitution">Greeks</religion>, <religion r_non_western="Hindu Prostitution">Indians</religion>, et al., was the ritual expression of respect and 
        veneration for the powers of fertility and generation. <power_system p_religion="Religion and Prostitution">The priestesses/prostitutes of the 
        temple were literal personifications of the life energy of the earth goddess, and transferred 
        that energy to those who participated in her rites. The cosmic principles, articulated as 
        divine male and divine female, were ritually united in the temple because clearly only 
        through their continuing and repeated union could the fertility of the earth and the well-being 
        of a people be ensured. Sacred prostitution was "nothing less than an act of communion 
        with god (or godhead) and was as remote from sensuality as the Christian act of communion 
        is remote from gluttony."</power_system> <structure fnote="Robert S. de Ropp, Sex Energy: The Sexual Force in Man and Animals (New York: Dell Publishing Company, 1969), p. 134.">8</structure> O and all of the women at Roissy are distinguished by their sterility 
        and bear no resemblance whatsoever to any known goddess. No mention is ever made of 
        conception or menstruation, and procreation is never a consequence of fucking. O's fertility 
        has been rendered O. There is nothing sacred about O's prostitution.
        </structure>
        <structure p="17">
        <power_system p_patriarchy="Initiation into Manhood">O's degradation is occasioned by the male need for and fear of initiation into manhood. 
        Initiation rites generally include a period of absolute solitude, isolation, followed by tests of 
        physical courage, mental endurance, often through torture and physical mutilation, resulting 
        in a permanent scar or tattoo which marks the successful initiate. The process of initiation 
        is designed to reveal the values, rites, and rules of manhood and confers on the initiate the 
        responsibilities and privileges of manhood.</power_system> What occurs at Roissy is a clear perversion of 
        real initiation. Rene and the others mutilate O's body, but they are themselves untouched. 
        Her body substitutes for their bodies. O is marked with the scars which they should bear. She 
        undergoes their ordeal for them, endures the solitude and isolation, the torture, the 
        mutilation. In trying to become gods, they have bypassed the necessary rigors of becoming 
        men. The fact that the tortures must be repeated endlessly, not only on O but on large 
        numbers of women who are forced as well as persuaded, demonstrates that the men of 
        Roissy never in fact become men, are never initiates, never achieve the security of realized 
        manhood.
        </structure>
        <structure p="18">
        <power_system p_patriarchy="Male ownership in marriage">What would be the sign of the initiate, the final mark or scar, manifests in the case of O as an 
        ultimate expression of sadism. The rings through O's cunt with Sir Stephen's name and 
        heraldry, and the brand on her ass, are permanent wedding rings rightly placed. They mark 
        her as an owned object and in no way symbolize the passage into maturity and freedom. The 
        same might be said of the conventional wedding ring.</power_system>
        </structure>
        <structure p="19">
        <power_system p_social="heteronormativity">O, in her never-ending role as surrogate everything, also is the direct sexual link between Sir 
        Stephen and Rene. That the two men love each other and fuck each other through O is made 
        clear by the fact that Sir Stephen uses O anally most of the time. The consequences of 
        misdirecting sexual energy are awesome indeed.</power_system>
        </structure>
        <structure p="20">
        But what is most extraordinary about Story of O is the mind-boggling literary style of Pauline 
        Reage, its author. O is wanton yet pure, Sir Stephen is cruel yet kind, Rene is brutal yet gentle, 
        a wall is black yet white. Everything is what it is, what it isn't, and its direct opposite. That 
        technique, which is so skillfully executed, might help to account for the compelling 
        irrationality of Story of O. For those women who are convinced yet doubtful, attracted yet 
        repelled, there is this schema for self-protection: the double-double think that the author 
        engages in is very easy to deal with if we just realize that we only have to double-double 
        unthink it.
        </structure>
        <structure p="21">
        <power_system p_patriarchy="Men possess power over all women">To sum up, Story of O is a story of psychic cannibalism, demonic possession, a story which 
        posits men and women as being at opposite poles of the universe--the survival of one 
        dependent on the absolute destruction of the other. It asks, like many stories, who is the 
        most powerful, and it answers: men are, literally over women's dead bodies.</power_system>
