<structure p="1">
My Dear Friend,— In attempting to comply with thy request to give my views on
the Province of Woman, I feel that I am venturing on nearly untrodden
ground, and that <religion r_quaker="anti-anglican">I shall advance
arguments in opposition to a corrupt public opinion, and to the
perverted interpretation of Holy Writ</religion>, which has so
universally obtained. But I am in search of truth; and no obstacle shall
prevent my prosecuting that search, because I believe the welfare of the
world will be materially advanced by every new discovery we make of the
<religion r_christianity="determinism">designs of Jehovah in the
creation of woman</religion>. It is impossible that we can answer
the purpose of our being, unless we understand that purpose. It is
impossible that we should fulfil our duties, unless we comprehend them; or
live up to our privileges, unless we know what they are. 
</structure>

<structure p="2">
In examining this important subject, <religion r_quaker="Grimke's religion">I shall depend
solely on the Bible to designate the sphere of woman</religion>,
because I believe almost every thing that has been written on this subject,
has been the result of a misconception of the simple truths revealed in the
Scriptures, in consequence of the false translation of many passages of Holy
Writ. <religion r_anglican="On the Church of England and KJB"> My mind is
entirely delivered from the superstitious reverence which is
attached to the English version of the Bible. King James’s
translators certainly were not inspired.</religion> I therefore
claim the original as my standard, believing that to have been inspired, and
I also claim to judge for myself what is the meaning of the inspired
writers, because <s_theory
s_enlightenment_individualism="Potentially Protestant "> I believe
it to be the solemn duty of every individual to search the
Scriptures for themselves, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, and not
be governed by the views of any man, or set of men.</s_theory> 
</structure>

<structure p="3">
<religion r_christianity="general">We must first view woman at the period of her creation.</religion> ‘And God said, Let us
make man in our own image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he
him, male and female created he them.’ <s_theory
s_rights_of_man="Natural Rights"> In all this sublime description of
the creation of man, (which is a generic term including man and
woman,) there is not one particle of difference intimated as
existing between them. They were both made in the image of God;
dominion was given to both over every other creature, but not over
each other. Created in perfect equality, they were expected to
exercise the vicegerence intrusted to them by their Maker, in
harmony and love. </s_theory> 
</structure>

<structure p="4">
<religion r_christianity="general">Let us pass on now to the
recapitulation of the creation of man:</religion>—‘<structure q="bible">The Lord God formed man of the dust
of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
became a living soul. And the Lord God said, it is not good that man should
be alone, I will make him an help meet for him.’</structure> 
<s_theory s_natural_rights="Evolutionary creationism ">All creation swarmed with
animated beings capable of natural affection, as we know they still are; it
was not, therefore, merely to give man a creature susceptible of loving,
obeying, and looking up to him, for all that the animals could do and did
do. It was to give him a companion, in all respects his equal; one who was
like himself a free agent, gifted with intellect and endowed with
immortality; not a partaker merely of his animal gratifications, but able to
enter into all his feelings as a moral and responsible being.</s_theory> If this had
not been the case, how could she have been an help meet for him? <s_theory s_natural_rights="determinism, theistic view of natural rights">I
understand this as applying not only to the parties entering into the
marriage contract, but to all men and women, because I believe God designed
woman to be an help meet for man in every good and perfect work</s_theory>. She was a
part of himself, as if Jehovah designed to make the oneness and identity of
man and woman perfect and complete; and when the glorious work of their
creation was finished, ‘the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of
God shouted for joy.’
</structure>

<structure p="5">
<religion r_christianity="Eve, apple">This blissful condition was not long enjoyed by our
first parents. Eve, it would seem from the history, was wandering alone amid
the bowers of Paradise, when the serpent met with her.</religion> <religion r_christianity="Eve">From her reply
to Satan, it is evident that the command not to eat ‘of the tree that is in
the midst of the garden,’ was given to both, although the term man was used
when the prohibition was issued by God.</religion> ‘And the woman said unto the
serpent, WE may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, but of the
fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, <religion r_christianity="Eve's ignorance">God hath said, YE
shall not eat of it, neither shall YE touch it, lest YE die.’ Here the woman
was exposed to temptation from a being with whom she was unacquainted. She
had been accustomed to associate with her beloved partner, and to hold
communion with God and with angels; but of satanic intelligence, she was in
all probability entirely ignorant. Through the subtlety of the serpent, she
was beguiled.</religion> And ‘when she saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she
took of the fruit thereof and did eat.’
</structure> 

<structure p="6">
<power_system p_religion="socio-religious, adam + eve equally susceptible to influence but retain state of no sin through piety">We next find Adam involved in the
same sin, not through the instrumentality of a supernatural agent, but
through that of his equal, a being whom he must have known was liable to
transgress the divine command, because he must have felt that he was himself
a free agent, and that he was restrained from disobedience only by the
exercise of faith and love towards his Creator.</power_system> <s_theory s_natural_rights="Religious justification; Adam not superior to Eve">Had Adam tenderly reproved
his wife, and endeavored to lead her to repentance instead of sharing in her
guilt, I should be much more ready to accord to man that superiority which
he claims; but as the facts stand disclosed by the sacred historian, it
appears to me that to say the least, there was as much weakness exhibited by
Adam as by Eve. They both fell from innocence, and consequently from
happiness, but not from equality. </s_theory>
</structure> 

<structure p="7">
Let us next examine the conduct of this
fallen pair, when Jehovah interrogated them respecting their fault. They
both frankly confessed their guilt. <structure q="Uncredited, likely Biblical">‘The man said, the woman whom thou
gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat. And the woman
said, the serpent beguiled me and I did eat.’ <power_system p_patriarchy="God ordained Adam to rule over Eve">And the Lord God said unto the
woman, ‘Thou wilt be subject unto thy husband, and he will rule over thee.’</power_system></structure>
<power_system p_social="Disagreeing with patrriarchical interpretation">That this did not allude to the subjection of woman to man is manifest,
because the same mode of expression is used in speaking to Cain of Abel.</power_system> The
truth is that the curse, as it is termed, which was pronounced by Jehovah
upon woman, is a simple prophecy. The Hebrew, like the French language, uses
the same word to express shall and will. Our translators having been
accustomed to exercise lordship over their wives, and seeing only through
the medium of a perverted judgment, very naturally, though I think not very
learnedly or very kindly, translated it shall instead of will, and thus
converted a prediction to Eve into a command to Adam; for observe, it is
addressed to the woman and not to the man. The consequence of the fall was
an immediate struggle for dominion, and Jehovah foretold which would gain
the ascendency; <religion r_quaker="Genesis 9:6, interpreted as sin makes no value distinction between people">but as he created them in his image, as that image
manifestly was not lost by the fall, because it is urged in Gen. 9: 6, as an
argument why the life of man should not be taken by his fellow man, there is
no reason to suppose that sin produced any distinction between them as
moral, intellectual and responsible beings.</religion> 
Man might just as well
have endeavored by hard labor to fulfil the prophecy, thorns and thistles
will the earth bring forth to thee, as to pretend to accomplish the other,
‘he will rule over thee,’ by asserting dominion over his wife.

<structure date="July 17th, 1837"><setting>Newburyport</setting>, 7th mo. 17, 1837. </structure>

<structure p="10">
My dear Sister,—In my last, I traced the
creation and the fall of man and woman from that state of purity and happiness which
their beneficent Creator designed them to enjoy. As they were one in transgression,
their chastisement was the same. <structure q="Uncredited, likely Biblical">‘So God drove out the man, and he placed at the
East of the garden of Eden a cherubim and a flaming sword, which turned every way to
keep the way of the tree of life.’</structure> We now behold them expelled from Paradise, fallen
from their original loveliness, but still bearing on their foreheads the image and
superscription of Jehovah; still invested with high moral responsibilities,
intellectual powers, and immortal souls. <s_theory s_natural_rights="Religious justification">They had incurred the penalty of sin, they
were shorn of their innocence, but they stood on the same platform side by side,
acknowledging no superior but their God.</s_theory> <power_system p_patriarchy="Woman introduced sin">Notwithstanding what has been urged, woman
I am aware stands charged to the present day with having brought sin into the world.</power_system>
I shall not repel the charge by any counter assertions, although, as was before
hinted, Adam’s ready acquiescence with his wife’s proposal, does not savor
much of that superiority in strength of mind, which is arrogated by man. <power_system p_patriarchy="Men have benefit or are satisfied with undervaluing women">Even
admitting that Eve was the greater sinner, it seems to me man might be satisfied
with the dominion he has claimed and exercised for nearly six thousand years, and
that more true nobility would be manifested by endeavoring to raise the fallen and
invigorate the weak, than by keeping woman in subjection.</power_system> But I ask no favors for my
sex. I surrender not our claim to equality. <power_system p_patriarchy="If women are not freed from patriarchical rule, they will become weaker">
All I ask of our brethren is, that they
will take their feet from off our necks, and permit us to stand upright on that
ground which God designed us to occupy. If he has not given us the rights which
have, as I conceive, been wrested from us, we shall soon give evidence of our
inferiority, and shrink back into that obscurity, which the high souled magnanimity
of man has assigned us as our appropriate sphere.</power_system></structure> 

<structure p="11">As I am unable to learn from
sacred writ when woman was deprived by God of her equality with man, I shall touch
upon a few points in the Scriptures, which demonstrate that no supremacy was granted
to man. When God had destroyed the world, except Noah and his family, by the deluge,
he renewed the grant formerly made to man, and again gave him dominion over every
beast of the earth, every fowl of the air, over all that moveth upon the earth, and
over all the fishes of the sea; into his hands they were delivered. <s_theory s_natural_rights="Religious justificatoin">But was woman,
bearing the image of her God, placed under the dominion of her fellow man? Never!
Jehovah could not surrender his authority to govern his own immortal creatures into
the hands of a being, whom he knew, and whom his whole history proved, to be
unworthy of a trust so sacred and important. God could not do it, because it is a
direct contravention of his law, </s_theory> 
<structure q="Uncredited, likely Biblical">‘Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve.’</structure><religion r_christianity="General"> <s_theory s_natural_rights="Religious justification">If Jehovah had appointed man as the guardian, or teacher of
woman, he would certainly have given some intimation of this surrender of his own
prerogative. But so far from it, we find the commands of God invariably the same to
man and woman; and not the slightest intimation is given in a single passage of the
Bible, that God designed to point woman to man as her instructor.</s_theory></religion> The tenor of his
language always is, ‘Look unto ME, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth, for I
am God, and there is none else.’ </structure>

<structure p="12"><religion r_christianity="Corruption and sin equally represented between sexes">The lust of dominion was probably the first effect
of the fall; and as there was no other intelligent being over whom to exercise it,
woman was the first victim of this unhallowed passion. We afterwards see it
exhibited by Cain in the murder of his brother, by Nimrod in his becoming a mighty
hunter of men, and setting up a kingdom over which to reign. Here we see the origin
of that Upas of slavery, which sprang up immediately after the fall, and has spread
its pestilential branches over the whole face of the known world.</religion> <power_system p_patriarchy="Historical">All history
attests that man has subjected woman to his will, used her as a means to promote his
selfish gratification, to minister to his sensual pleasures, to be instrumental in
promoting his comfort; but never has he desired to elevate her to that rank she was
created to fill. He has done all he could to debase and enslave her mind; and now he
looks triumphantly on the ruin he has wrought, and says, the being he has thus
deeply injured is his inferior.</power_system></structure> 

<structure p="13"><power_system p_patriarchy="Women oppressed in 'all ages and countries'">Woman has been placed by John Quincy Adams,
side by side with the slave, whilst he was contending for the right side of
petition. I thank him for ranking us with the oppressed; for I shall not find it
difficult to show, that in all ages and countries, not even excepting enlightened
republican America, woman has more or less been made a means to promote the welfare
of man, without due regard to her own happiness, and the glory of God as the end of
her creation.</power_system> </structure>

<structure p="14"><power_system p_patriarchy="Defines patriarchy as former period">During the patriarchal ages, we find men and women engaged in the same
employments.</power_system> Abraham and Sarah both assisted in preparing the food which was to be
set before the three men, who visited them in the plains of Mamre; but although
their occupations were similar, 
<power_system p_patriarchy="Male family excerts control over female family">Sarah was not permitted to enjoy the society of the
holy visitant; and as we learn from Peter, that she ‘obeyed Abraham, calling him
Lord,’ we may presume he exercised dominion over her.</power_system> We shall pass on now to
Rebecca. In her history, we find another striking illustration of the low estimation
in which woman was held. Eleazur is sent to seek a wife for Isaac. He finds Rebecca
going down to the well to fill her pitcher. He accosts her; and she replies with all
humility, ‘Drink, my lord.’ How does he endeavor to gain her favor and confidence?
Does he approach her as a dignified creature, whom he was about to invite to fill an
important station in his master’s family, as the wife of his only son? No. He
offered incense to her vanity, and ‘he took a golden ear-ring of half a shekel
weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,’ and gave
them to Rebecca.</structure> 

<structure p="15"><religion r_christianity="Cupidity, sin of greed">The cupidity of man soon led him to regard woman as
property, and hence we find them sold to those, who wished to marry them, as far as
appears, without any regard to those sacred rights which belong to woman, as well as
to man in the choice of a companion.</religion> That women were a profitable kind of property,
we may gather from the description of a virtuous woman in the last chapter of
Proverbs. To work willingly with her hands, to open her hands to the poor, to clothe
herself with silk and purple, to look well to her household, to make fine linen and
sell it, to deliver girdles to the merchant, and not to eat the bread of idleness,
seems to have constituted in the view of Solomon, the perfection of a woman’s
character and achievements. <structure q="Abolitionist and women's rights activist Lydia Maria Child's 'Condition of Women, in Various Ages and Nations', 1835">‘The spirit of that age was not favorable to
intellectual improvement; but <s_theory s_enlightenment_individualism=" Individual intelligent people create societal progress, regardless of gender">as there were wise men who formed exceptions to the
general ignorance, and were destined to guide the world into more advanced states,
so there was a corresponding proportion of wise women</s_theory>; <religion r_judaism="Unlike English/American Christianity, Judaism views women as holier than men">and among the Jews, as well
as other nations, we find a strong tendency to believe that women were in more
immediate connection with heaven than men.</religion>’</structure>—L. M. Child’s Con. of Woman. If there be
any truth in this tradition, I am at a loss to imagine in what the superiority of
man consists.</structure>

<structure subhead="4">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE OF THE SEXES. 
</structure>
<structure date="July 27th, 1837"><setting>Andover</setting>, 7th Mo. 27th, 1837. </structure>
<structure p="25">My Dear Friend,—Before I proceed with the
account of that oppression which woman has suffered in every age and country from
her protector, man, permit me to offer for your consideration, some views relative
to the social intercourse of the sexes. Nearly the whole of this intercourse is, in
my apprehension, derogatory to man and woman, as moral and intellectual beings. We
approach each other, and mingle with each other, under the constant pressure of a
feeling that we are of different sexes; and, instead of regarding each other only in
the light of immortal creatures, the mind is fettered by the idea which is early and
industriously infused into it, that we must never forget the distinction between
male and female. Hence our intercourse, instead of being elevated and refined, is
generally calculated to excite and keep alive the lowest propensities of our nature.
Nothing, I believe, has tended more to destroy the true dignity of woman, than the
fact that she is approached by man in the character of a female. The idea that she
is sought as an intelligent and heaven-born creature, whose society will
cheer, refine and elevate her companion, and that she will receive the same
blessings she confers, is rarely held up to her view. On the contrary, man almost
always addresses himself to the weakness of woman. By flattery, by an appeal to her
passions, he seeks access to her heart; and when he has gained her affections, he
uses her as the instrument of his pleasure—the minister of his temporal comfort. He
furnishes himself with a housekeeper, whose chief business is in the kitchen, or the
nursery. And whilst he goes abroad and enjoys the means of improvement afforded by
collision of intellect with cultivated minds, his wife is condemned to draw nearly
all her instruction from books, if she has time to peruse them; and if not, from her
meditations, whilst engaged in those domestic duties, which are necessary for the
comfort of her lord and master. </structure>

<structure p="26">Surely no one who contemplates, with the eye of a
Christian philosopher, the design of God in the creation of woman, can believe that
she is now fulfilling that design. The literal translation of the word ‘help-meet’
is a helper like unto himself; it is so rendered in the Septuagint, and manifestly
signifies a companion. Now I believe it will be impossible for woman to fill the
station assigned her by God, until her brethren mingle with her as an equal, as a
moral being; and lose, in the dignity of her immortal nature, and in the fact of her
bearing like himself the image and superscription of her God, the idea of her being
a female. The apostle beautifully remarks, ‘As many of you as have been baptized
into Christ, have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in
Christ Jesus.’ Until our intercourse is purified by the forgetfulness of sex,—until
we rise above the present low and sordid views which entwine themselves around our
social and domestic interchange of sentiment and feelings, we never can derive that
benefit from each other’s society which it is the design of our Creator that we
should. Man has inflicted an unspeakable injury upon woman, by holding up to her
view her animal nature, and placing in the back ground her moral and intellectual
being. Woman has inflicted an injury upon herself by submitting to be thus regarded;
and she is now called upon to rise from the station where man, not God, has placed
her, and claim those sacred and inalienable rights, as a moral and responsible
being, with which her Creator has invested her. </structure>

<structure p="27">What but these views, so derogatory
to the character of woman, could have called forth the remark contained in the
Pastoral Letter? ‘We especially deplore the intimate acquaintance and promiscuous
conversation of females with regard to things “which ought not to be named,” by
which that modesty and delicacy, which is the charm of domestic life, and which
constitutes the true influence of woman, is consumed.’ How wonderful that the
conceptions of man relative to woman are so low, that he cannot perceive that she
may converse on any subject connected with the improvement of her species, without
swerving in the least from that modesty which is one of her greatest virtues! Is it
designed to insinuate that woman should possess a greater degree of modesty than
man? This idea I utterly reprobate. Or is it supposed that woman cannot go
into scenes of misery, the necessary result of those very things, which the Pastoral
Letter says ought not to be named, for the purpose of moral reform, without becoming
contaminated by those with whom she thus mingles? </structure>

<structure p="28">This is a false position; and I
presume has grown out of the never-forgotten distinction of male and female. The
woman who goes forth, clad in the panoply of God, to stem the tide of iniquity and
misery, which she beholds rolling through our land, goes not forth to her labor of
love as a female. She goes as the dignified messenger of Jehovah, and all she does
and says must be done and said irrespective of sex. She is in duty bound to
communicate with all, who are able and willing to aid her in saving her fellow
creatures, both men and women, from that destruction which awaits them. </structure>

<structure p="29">So far from
woman losing any thing of the purity of her mind, by visiting the wretched victims
of vice in their miserable abodes, by talking with them, or of them, she becomes
more and more elevated and refined in her feelings and views. While laboring to
cleanse the minds of others from the malaria of moral pollution, her own heart
becomes purified, and her soul rises to nearer communion with her God. Such a woman
is infinitely better qualified to fulfil the duties of a wife and a mother, than the
woman whose false delicacy leads her to shun her fallen sister and brother, and
shrink from naming those sins which she knows exist, but which she is too fastidious
to labor by deed and by word to exterminate. Such a woman feels when she enters upon
the marriage relation, that God designed that relation not to debase her to a
level with the animal creation, but to increase the happiness and dignity of his
creatures. Such a woman comes to the important task of training her children in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord, with a soul filled with the greatness of the
beings committed to her charge. She sees in her children, creatures bearing the
image of God; and she approaches them with reverence, and treats them at all times
as moral and accountable beings. Her own mind being purified and elevated, she
instils into her children that genuine religion which induces them to keep the
commandments of God. Instead of ministering with ceaseless care to their sensual
appetites, she teaches them to be temperate in all things. She can converse with her
children on any subject relating to their duty to God, can point their attention to
those vices which degrade and brutify human nature, without in the least defiling
her own mind or theirs. She views herself, and teaches her children to regard
themselves as moral beings; and in all their intercourse with their fellow men, to
lose the animal nature of man and woman, in the recognition of that immortal mind
wherewith Jehovah has blessed and enriched them.</structure>

<structure p="30">My Dear Sister,—I design to devote this letter to a brief examination of
the condition of women in Asia and Africa. I believe it will be found that men, in
the exercise of their usurped dominion over woman, have almost invariably done one
of two things. They have either made slaves of the creatures whom God designed to be
their companions and their coadjutors in every moral and intellectual improvement,
or they have dressed them like dolls, and used them as toys to amuse their hours of
recreation. </structure>

<structure p="31">I shall commence by stating the degrading practice of SELLING WOMEN,
which we find prevalent in almost all the Eastern nations.</structure> 
<structure p="32">Among the Jews,— </structure>

<structure q="uncredited">
<structure p="33">
‘Whoever wished for a wife must pay the parents for her, or perform a stipulated period of
service; sometimes the parties were solemnly betrothed in childhood, and the price
of the bride stipulated.’
</structure> </structure>

<structure p="34">In Babylon, they had a yearly custom of a peculiar kind.
</structure>

<structure q="uncredited"> <structure p="35">‘In every district, three men, respectable for their virtue, were chosen to conduct
all the marriageable girls to the public assembly. Here they were put up at auction
by the public crier, while the magistrate presided over the sales. The most
beautiful were sold first, and the rich contended eagerly for a choice. The most
ugly, or deformed girl was sold next in succession to the handsomest, and assigned
to any person who would take her with the least sum of money. The price given for
the beautiful was divided into dowries for the homely.’</structure> </structure>

<structure p="36">Two things may here be
noticed; first, the value set upon personal charms, just as a handsome horse
commands a high price; and second, the utter disregard which is manifested towards
the feelings of woman.</structure> 


<structure q="uncredited">
<structure p="37">‘In no part of the world does the condition of women appear
more dreary than in Hindostan. The arbitrary power of a father disposes of them in
childhood. When they are married, their husbands have despotic control over them; if
unable to support them, they can lend or sell them to a neighbor, and in the Hindoo
rage for gambling, wives and children are frequently staked and lost. If they
survive their husbands, they must pay implicit obedience to the oldest son; if they
have no sons, the nearest male relation holds them in subjection; and if there
happen to be no kinsmen, they must be dependent on the chief of the tribe.’</structure> </structure>
<structure p="38">Even the English, who are numerous in Hindostan, have traded in women. 
</structure>

<structure q="uncredited"><structure p="39">‘India has been a
great marriage market, on account of the emigration of young enterprising
Englishmen, without a corresponding number of women. Some persons actually imported
women to the British settlements, in order to sell them to rich Europeans, or
nabobs, who would give a good price for them. How the importers acquired a right
thus to dispose of them is not mentioned; it is probable that the women themselves,
from extreme poverty, or some other cause, consented to become articles of
speculation, upon consideration of receiving a certain remuneration. In September,
1818, the following advertisement appeared in the Calcutta Advertiser:</structure> 

<structure q="Calcutta Advertiser"> <structure p="40">FEMALES RAFFLED FOR</structure>. </structure>

<structure p="41">Be it known, that six fair pretty young ladies, with two sweet engaging
children, lately imported from Europe, having the roses of health blooming on their
cheeks, and joy sparkling in their eyes, possessing amiable tempers and highly
accomplished, whom the most indifferent cannot behold without rapture, are to be

</structure>  
<structure p="42">The enemy of all good could not have devised a better means of debasing an immortal creature, than by turning
her into a saleable commodity; and hence we find that wherever this custom prevails,
woman is regarded as a mere machine to answer the purposes of domestic combat or
sensual indulgence, or to gratify the taste of her oppressor by a display of
personal attractions.</structure>

<structure p="44">I shall now take a brief survey of the EMPLOYMENTS of
women in Asia and Africa. In doing this, I have two objects in view; first to show,
that women are capable of acquiring as great physical power as men, and secondly to
show, that they have been more or less the victims of oppression and contempt.</structure> 


<structure q="uncredited"> <structure p="45">‘The occupations of the ancient Jewish women were laborious. They spent their time in
spinning and weaving cloth for garments, and for the covering of the tents, in
cooking the food, tending the flocks, grinding the corn, and drawing water from the
wells.’</structure> </structure>

<structure p="46">Of Trojan women we know little, but we find that—</structure>

    <structure q="uncredited"> <structure p="47">‘Andromache, though a princess and well beloved by her husband, fed and took care of the horses of
Hector.’</structure> </structure>
<structure p="48">So in Persia, women of the middling class see that proper care is taken of
    the horses. They likewise do all the laborious part of the house work.</structure> 

<structure q="uncredited">
<structure p="49">
‘The Hindoo women are engaged in every variety of occupation, according to the caste of their
husbands. They cultivate the land, make baskets and mats, bring water in jars, carry
manure and various other articles to market in baskets on their heads, cook
food, tend children, weave cloth, reel thread and wind cocoons.’</structure>

<structure p="50">‘The Thibetian women of the laboring classes are inured to a great deal of toil. They plant, weed,
reap, and thresh grain, and are exposed to the roughest weather, while their
indolent husbands are perhaps living at their ease.’</structure> 

<structure p="51">‘Females of the lower classes among the Chinese endure as much labor and fatigue as the men. A wife sometimes
drags the plough in rice fields with an infant tied upon her back, while her husband
performs the less arduous task of holding the plough.’</structure> 

<structure p="52">‘The Tartar women in general perform a greater share of labor than the men; for it is a prevalent opinion that
they were sent into the world for no other purpose, but to be useful and convenient
SLAVES to the stronger sex.’ ‘Among some of the Tartar tribes of the present day,
females manage a horse, hurl a javelin, hunt wild animals, and fight an enemy as
well as the men.’</structure>

<structure p="53">‘In the island of Sumatra, the women do all the work, while their
husbands lounge in idleness, playing on the flute, with wreaths of globe amaranth on
their heads, or racing with each other, without saddle or stirrup, or hunting deer,
or gambling away their wives, their children, or themselves. The Battas consider
their wives and children as slaves, and sell them whenever they choose.’</structure>

<structure p="54">‘The Moors are indolent to excess. They lie whole days upon their mats, sleeping and smoking,
while the women and slaves perform all the labor. Owing to their uncleanly habits,
they are much infested with vermin; and as they consider it beneath their dignity to
remove this annoyance, the task is imposed on the women. They are very impatient and
tyrannical, and for the slightest offence beat their wives most cruelly.’</structure>

<structure p="55">In looking over the condition of woman as delineated in this letter, how amply do we find the
prophecy of Jehovah to Eve fulfilled, ‘Thy husband will rule over thee.’ And yet we
perceive that where the physical strength of woman is called into exercise, there is
no inferiority even in this respect; she performs the labor, while man enjoys what
are termed the pleasures of life.</structure>

<structure p="56">I have thought it necessary to adduce
various proofs of my assertion, that men have always in some way regarded women as
mere instruments of selfish gratification; and hope this sorrowful detail of the
wrongs of woman will not be tedious to thee</structure>.

<structure subhead="6">WOMEN IN ASIA AND AFRICA. 
</structure>
<structure date="August 15th, 1837"><setting>Groton</setting>, 8th Mo. 15th, 1837. </structure>
    
<structure p="57">Dear Friend,—In pursuing the history of woman in different ages and countries, it
will be necessary to exhibit her in all the various situations in which she has been
placed.</structure> 

<structure p="58">We find her sometimes filling the throne, and exercising the functions of
royalty. The name of Semiramis is familiar to every reader of ancient history. She
succeeded Ninus in the government of the Assyrian empire; and to render her name
immortal, built the city of Babylon. Two millions of men were constantly employed
upon it. Certain dykes built by order of this queen, to defend the city from
inundations, are spoken of as admirable.</structure>

<structure p="59">Nicotris, wife of Nabonadius, the
Evil-Merodach of Scripture, was a woman of great endowments. While her husband
indulged in a life of ease and pleasure, she managed the affairs of state with
wisdom and prudence.</structure>

<structure q="uncredited">
<structure p="60">‘Zenobia queen of Palmyra and the East, is the most remarkable
among Asiatic women. Her genius struggled with and overcame all the obstacles
presented by oriental laws and customs. She knew the Latin, Greek, Syriac, and
Egyptian languages; and had drawn up for her own use an abridgement of oriental
history. She was the companion and friend of her husband, and accompanied him
on his hunting excursions with eagerness and courage equal to his own. She despised
the effeminacy of a covered carriage, and often appeared on horseback in military
costume. Sometimes she marched several miles on foot, at the head of the troops.
Having revenged the murder of her husband, she ascended the throne, and for five
years governed Palmyra, Syria, and the East, with wonderful steadiness and wisdom.’</structure>

<structure p="61">‘Previous to the introduction of Mohammedism into Java, women often held the highest
offices of government; and when the chief of a district dies, it is even now not
uncommon for the widow to retain the authority that belonged to her deceased
husband.’</structure> 
</structure>

<structure p="62">Other instances might be adduced to prove that there is no natural
inferiority in woman. Not that I approve of woman’s holding the reins of government
over man. I maintain that they are equal, and that God never invested fallen man
with unlimited power over his fellow man; and I rejoice that circumstances have
prevented woman from being more deeply involved in the guilt which appears to be
inseparable from political affairs. The few instances which I have mentioned prove
that intellect is not sexed; and doubtless if woman had not almost universally been
depressed and degraded, the page of history would have exhibited as many eminent
statesmen and politicians among women as men. We are much in the situation of the
slave. Man has asserted and assumed authority over us. He has, by virtue of his
power, deprived us of the advantages of improvement which he has lavishly bestowed
upon himself, and then, after having done all he can to take from us the means of
proving our equality, and our capability of mental cultivation, he throws upon us
the burden of proof that God created man and woman equal, and endowed them, without
any reference to sex, with intelligence and responsibilities, as rational and
accountable beings. Hence in Hindostan, even women of the higher classes are
forbidden to read or write; because the Hindoos think it would inevitably spoil them
for domestic life, and assuredly bring some great misfortune upon them. May we not
trace to the same feeling, the disadvantages under which women labor even in this
country, for want of an education, which would call into exercise the powers of her
mind, and fortify her soul with those great moral principles by which she would be
qualified to fill every department in social, domestic and religious life with
dignity?</structure>
<structure p="63">In Hindostan, the evidence of women is not received in a court of justice. </structure>
<structure p="64">In Burmah, their testimony is not deemed equal to that of a man, and they are not
allowed to ascend the steps of a court of justice, but are obliged to give their
testimony outside of the building.</structure> 
<structure p="65">In Siberia, women are not allowed to step across
the foot-prints of men, or reindeer; they are not allowed to eat with men, or to
partake of particular dainties. Among many tribes, they seem to be regarded as
impure, unholy beings.</structure>
<structure q="uncredited">
<structure p="66">‘The Mohammedan law forbids pigs, dogs, women and other
impure animals to enter a mosque; and the hour of prayers must not be proclaimed by
a female, a madman, a drunkard, or a decrepit person.’</structure>
</structure> 
<structure p="67">Here I am reminded of the resemblance between the situation of women in heathen and Mohammedan countries, and
our brethren and sisters of color in this Christian land, where[Pg 35] they are
despised and cast out as though they were unclean. And on precisely the same ground,
because they are said to be inferior.</structure>
<structure p="68">The treatment of women as wives is almost
uniformly the same in all heathen countries.</structure>
<structure p="69">The ancient Lydians are the only
exception that I have met with, and the origin of their peculiar customs is so much
obscured by fable, that it is difficult to ascertain the truth. Probably they arose
from some great benefit conferred on the state by women.</structure>
<structure p="70">Among the Druses who reside
in the mountains of the Anti Libanus, a wife is often divorced on the slightest
pretext. If she ask her husband’s permission to go out, and he says,—‘Go,’ without
adding ‘but come back again,’ she is divorced.</structure>
<structure p="71">In Siberia, it is considered a wife’s
duty to obey the most capricious and unreasonable demands of her husband, without
one word of expostulation or inquiry. If her master be dissatisfied with the most
trifling particular in her conduct, he tears the cap or veil from her head, and this
constitutes a divorce.</structure>
<structure p="72">A Persian woman, under the dominion of the kindest master, is
treated much in the same manner as a favorite animal. To vary her personal graces
for his pleasure, is the sole end and aim of her existence. As moral or intellectual
beings, it would be better for them to be among the dead than the living. The mother
instructs her daughter in all the voluptuous coquetry, by which she herself acquired
precarious ascendency over her absolute master; but all that is truly estimable in
female character is utterly neglected. </structure>
<structure p="73">Hence we find women extravagantly fond of
adorning their persons. Regarded as instruments of pleasure, they have been
degraded into mere animals, and have found their own gratification principally in
the indulgence of personal vanity, because their external charms procured for them,
at least a temporary ascendency over those, who held in their hands the reins of
government. A few instances must suffice, or I shall exceed the limits I have
prescribed to myself in this letter. </structure>
<structure p="74">During the magnificent prosperity of Israel,
marriages were conducted with great pomp; and with the progress of luxury and
refinement, women became expensive, rather than profitable in a pecuniary point of
view. Hence probably arose the custom of wealthy parents giving a handsome dowry
with their daughters. On the day of the nuptials, the bride was conducted by her
female relations to the bath, where she was anointed with the choicest perfumes, her
hair perfumed and braided, her eyebrows deepened with black powder, and the tips of
her fingers tinged with rose color. She was then arrayed in a marriage robe of
brilliant color; the girdle and bracelets were more or less costly.</structure>
<structure p="75">Notwithstanding
the Chinese women have no opportunity to rival each other in the conquest of hearts,
they are nevertheless very fond of ornaments. Bunches of silver or gilt flowers are
always interspersed among their ringlets, and sometimes they wear the Chinese phœnix
made of silver gilt. It moves with the slightest motion of the wearer, and the
spreading tail forms a glittering aigrette on the middle of the head, and the wings
wave over the front. Yet a Chinese ballad says,—The pearls and precious stones, the
silk and gold with which a coquette so studiously bedecks herself, are a
transparent varnish which makes all her defects the more apparent.</structure>
<structure p="76">The Moorish women
have generally a great passion for ornament. They decorate their persons with heavy
gold ear-rings, necklaces of amber, coral and gold; gold bracelets; gold chains and
silver bells for the ankles; rings on the fingers, &amp;c. &amp;c. The poorer class
wear glass beads around the head, and curl the hair in large ringlets. Men are proud
of having their wives handsomely dressed. </structure>

<structure p="77">The Moors are not peculiar in this fancy.
Christian men still admire women who adorn their persons to gratify the lust of the
eye and the pride of life. Women, says a Brahminical expositor, are characterized by
an inordinate love of jewels, fine clothes, &amp;c. &amp;c. I cannot deny this
charge, but it is only one among many instances, wherein men have reproached us with
those very faults and vices which their own treatment has engendered. Is it any
matter of surprise that women, when unnaturally deprived of the means of cultivating
their minds, of objects which would elevate and refine their passions and
affections, should seek gratification in the toys and the trifles which now too
generally engage their attention?</structure>

<structure p="78">I cannot close this, without acknowledging the
assistance and information I have derived, and shall continue to derive on this part
of my subject, from a valuable work entitled ‘Condition of Women, by Lydia M.
Child.’ It is worth the perusal of every one who is interested in the subject. </structure>

</structure>
<structure subhead="7">CONDITION IN SOME PARTS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA. 
</structure>
<structure date="August 22nd, 1837">
    <setting>Brookline</setting>,
    8th Mo., 22d, 1837. 
</structure>
<structure p="79">Dear Sister,—I now come
to the consideration of the condition of woman in Europe.—In this portion of the
world, she does not appear to have been as uniformly or as deeply debased, as in
Eastern countries; yet we shall find little in her history which can yield us
satisfaction, when we regard the high station she was designed to occupy as a moral
and intellectual being.</structure>
<structure p="80">In Greece, if we may judge from what Eustathius says, ‘women
should keep within doors, and there talk,’—we may conclude, that in general their
occupations were chiefly domestic. Thucydides also declares, that ‘she was the best
woman, of whom the least was said, either of good or of harm.’ The heathen
philosophers doubtless wished to keep woman in her ‘appropriate sphere;’ and we find
our clerical brethren of the present day re-echoing these pagan sentiments, and
endeavoring to drive woman from the field of moral labor and intellectual culture,
to occupy her talents in the pursuit of those employments which will enable
her to regale the palate of her lord with the delicacies of the table, and in every
possible way minister to his animal comfort and gratification. In my humble opinion,
woman has long enough subserved the interests of man; and in the spirit of
self-sacrifice, submitted almost without remonstrance to his oppression; and now
that her attention is solicited to the subject of her rights, her privileges and her
duties, I would entreat her to double her diligence in the performance of all her
obligations as a wife, a mother, a sister, and a daughter. Let us remember that our
claim to stand on perfect equality with our brethren, can only be substantiated by a
scrupulous attention to our domestic duties, as well as by aiding in the great work
of moral reformation—a work which is now calling for the energies and consecrated
powers of every man and woman who desires to see the Redeemer’s kingdom established
on earth. That man must indeed be narrow minded, and can have but a poor conception
of the power of moral truth on the female heart, who supposes that a correct view of
her own rights can make woman less solicitous to fill up every department of duty.
If it should have this effect, it must be because she has not taken a comprehensive
view of the whole subject. </structure>
    
<structure p="81">In the history of Rome, we find a little spot of sunshine
in the valley where woman has been destined to live, unable from her lowly situation
to take an expansive view of that field of moral and mental improvement, which she
should have been busy in cultivating.</structure>
    
<structure q="uncredited"><structure p="82">‘In the earliest and best days of Rome, the
first magistrates and generals of armies ploughed their own fields, and
threshed their own grain. Integrity, industry and simplicity, were the prevailing
virtues of the times; and the character of woman was, as it always must be,
graduated in a degree by that of man. Columella says, Roman husbands, having
completed the labors of the day, entered their houses free from all care, and there
enjoyed perfect repose. There reigned union and concord and industry, supported by
mutual affections. The most beautiful woman depended for distinction on her economy
and endeavors to assist in crowning her husband’s diligence with prosperity. All was
in common between them; nothing was thought to belong more to one than another. The
wife by her assiduity and activity within doors, equalled and seconded the industry
and labor of her husband.’</structure>
</structure>
<structure p="83">In the then state of the world, we may conclude from this
description, that woman enjoyed as much happiness as was consistent with that
comparatively unimproved condition of our species; but now a new and vast sphere of
usefulness is opened to her, and she is pressed by surrounding circumstances to come
up to the help of the Lord against the giant sins which desolate our beloved
country. Shall woman shrink from duty in this exigency, and retiring within her own
domestic circle, delight herself in the abundance of her own selfish enjoyments?
Shall she rejoice in her home, her husband, her children, and forget her brethren
and sisters in bondage, who know not what it is to call a spot of earth their own,
whose husbands and wives are torn from them by relentless tyrants, and whose
children are snatched from their arms by their unfeeling task-masters, whenever
interest, or convenience, tempts them to this sacrilegious act? Shall woman
disregard the situation of thousands of her fellow creatures, who are the victims of
intemperance and licentiousness, and retreating to the privacy of her own
comfortable home, be satisfied that her whole duty is performed, when she can
exhibit ‘her children well clad and smiling, and her table neatly spread with
wholesome provisions?’ Shall she, because ‘her house is her home,’ refuse her aid
and her sympathy to the down trodden slave, to the poor unhappy outcasts who are
deprived of those blessings which she so highly prizes? Did God give her those
blessings to steel her heart to the sufferings of her fellow creatures? Did he grant
her the possession of husband and children, to dry up the fountains of feeling for
those who know not the consolations of tenderness and reciprocal affection? Ah no!
for every such blessing, God demands a grateful heart; and woman must be recreant to
her duty, if she can quietly sit down in the enjoyments of her own domestic circle,
and not exert herself to procure the same happiness for others.</structure>

<structure p="84">But it is said woman
has a mighty weapon in secret prayer. She has, I acknowledge, in common with man;
but the woman who prays in sincerity for the regeneration of this guilty world, will
accompany her prayers by her labors. A friend of mine remarked—‘I was sitting in my
chamber, weeping over the miseries of the slave, and putting up my petitions for his
deliverance from bondage; when in the midst of my meditations, it occurred to me
that my tears, unaided by effort, could never melt the chain of the slave. I must be
up and doing.’ She is now an active abolitionist—her prayers and her works go hand
in hand</structure>.

<structure p="85">I am here reminded of what a slave once said to his master, a Methodist
minister. The slaveholder inquired, ‘How did you like my sermon to-day?’
‘Very good, master, but it did not preach me free.</structure>’

<structure p="86">Oh, my sisters, suffer me to
entreat you to assert your privileges, and to perform your duties as moral beings.
Be not dismayed at the ridicule of man; it is a weapon worthy only of little minds,
and is employed by those who feel that they cannot convince our judgment. Be not
alarmed at contumely, or scorn; we must expect this. I pray that we may meet it with
forbearance and love; and that nothing may drive us from the performance of our high
and holy duties. Let us ‘cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for
wherein is he to be accounted of?’ and press forward in all the great moral
enterprises of the age, leaning only on the arm of our Beloved. </structure>
<structure p="87">But I must return to
the subject I commenced with, viz. the condition of woman in Europe.</structure> 

<structure q="uncredited"> <structure p="88">‘The northern nations bore a general resemblance to each other. War and hunting were considered
the only honorable occupations for men, and all other employments were left to women
and slaves. Even the Visigoths, on the coasts of Spain, left their fields and flocks
to the care of women. The people who inhabit the vast extent of country between the
Black sea and the North sea, are divided into various distinct races. The women are
generally very industrious; even in their walks, they carry a portable distaff, and
spin every step of the way. Both Croatian and Walachian women perform all the
agricultural operations in addition to their own domestic concerns.’</structure> </structure>

<structure p="89">Speaking of the
Morlachian women, M. Fortis says, ‘Being treated like beasts of burden, and expected
to endure submissively every species of hardship, they naturally become very dirty
and careless in their habits.’</structure> 

<structure p="90">The Cossack women afford a contrast to this
disgusting picture. They are very cleanly and industrious, and in the absence
of their husbands, supply their places by taking charge of all their usual
occupations, in addition to their own. It is rare for a Cossack woman not to know
some trade, such as dyeing cloth, tanning leather, &amp;c. 
</structure>

<structure p="91">The condition of Polish
and Russian serfs in modern times is about the same. The Polish women have scarcely
clothing enough for decency, and they are subjected to great hardships and
privations. ‘In Russia, women have been seen paving the streets, and performing
other similar drudgery. In Finland, they work like beasts of burden, and may be seen
for hours in snow water, up to the middle, tugging at boats and sledges.’
</structure>

<structure p="82">In Flanders and in France, women are engaged in performing laborious tasks; and even in
England, it is not unusual to see them scraping up manure from the streets with
their hands, and gathering it into baskets. 
</structure>

<structure p="83">In Greece, even now the women plough and
carry heavy burdens, while the lordly master of the family may be seen walking
before them without any incumbrance.[1]
</structure>

<structure p="84">Generally speaking, however, there
is much more comparative equality of labor between the sexes in Europe than among
the Orientals. 
</structure>

<structure p="85">I shall close this letter with a brief survey of the condition of
women among the Aborigines of America.</structure>

<structure>‘Before America was settled by Europeans, it
was inhabited by Indian tribes, which greatly resembled each other in the treatment
of their women. Every thing, except war and hunting, was considered beneath the
dignity of man.—During long and wearisome marches, women were obliged to carry
children, provisions and hammocks on their shoulders; they had the sole care of the
horses and dogs, cut wood, pitched the tents, raised the corn, and made the
clothing. When the husband killed game, he left it by a tree in the forest, returned
home, and sent his wife several miles in search of it. In most of the tribes, women
were not allowed to eat and drink with men, but stood and served them, and then ate
what they left.’ </structure>

<structure p="86">The following affecting anecdote may give some idea of the
sufferings of these women:</structure> 

<structure q="uncredited"><structure p="87">‘Father Joseph reproved a female savage for destroying
her infant daughter. She replied, “I wish my mother had thus prevented the manifold
sufferings I have endured. Consider, father, our deplorable situation. Our husbands
go out to hunt; we are dragged along with one infant at our breast, and another in a
basket. Though tired with long walking, we are not allowed to sleep when we return,
but must labor all night in grinding maize and making chica for them.—They get drunk
and beat us, draw us by the hair of the head, and tread us under foot. Would to God
my mother had put me under ground the moment I was born.”’ </structure></structure>

<structure p="88">In Greenland, the situation of woman is equally deplorable. The men hunt bears and catch seals; but
when they have towed their booty to land, they would consider it a disgrace to help
the women drag it home, or skin and dress it. They often stand and look idly on,
while their wives are staggering beneath the load that almost bends them to the
earth. The women are cooks, butchers, masons, curriers, shoemakers and tailors. They
will manage a boat in the roughest seas, and will often push off from the shore in
the midst of a storm, that would make the hardiest European sailor tremble. </structure>

<structure p="89">The page of history teems with woman’s wrongs, and it is wet with woman’s tears.—For the sake
of my degraded sex every where, and for the sake of my brethren, who suffer just in
proportion as they place woman lower in the scale of creation than man, lower than
her Creator placed her, I entreat my sisters to arise in all the majesty of moral
power, in all the dignity of immortal beings, and plant themselves, side by side, on
the platform of human rights, with man, to whom they were designed to be companions,
equals and helpers in every good word and work.</structure>

<structure fnote="1">FOOTNOTES: [1] Since the preceding letters were in type, I have met
with the following account in a French work entitled ‘De l’education des meres de
famille ou de la civilization du Genre Humain par les femmes,’ printed at Brussels
in 1837. ‘The periodicals have lately published the following circumstance from the
journal of an English physician, who travelled in the East. He visited a slave
market, where he saw about twenty Greek women half naked, lying on the ground
waiting for a purchaser. One of them attracted the attention of an old Turk. The
barbarian examined her shoulders, her legs, her ears, her mouth, her neck, with the
minutest care, just as a horse is examined, and during the inspection, the merchant
praised the beauty of her eyes, the elegance of her shape, and other perfections; he
protested that the poor girl was but thirteen years of age, &amp;c. After a severe
scrutiny and some dispute about the price, she was sold body and soul for 1375
francs. The soul, it is true, was accounted of little value in the bargain. The
unfortunate creature, half fainting in the arms of her mother, implored help in the
most touching accents, but it availed nothing.—This infernal scene passed in Europe
in 1829, only 600 leagues from Paris and London, the two capitals of the human
species, and at the time in which I write, it is the living history of two thirds of
the inhabitants of the earth.’</structure>

<structure subhead="8">ON THE CONDITION OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES</structure>. 
<structure date="1837"><setting>Brookline</setting>, 1837.</structure> 

<structure p="90">My dear Sister,—I have now taken a brief survey of
the condition of woman in various parts of the world. I regret that my time has been
so much occupied by other things, that I have been unable to bestow that attention
upon the subject which it merits, and that my constant change of place has prevented
me from having access to books, which might probably have assisted me in this part
of my work. I hope that the principles I have asserted will claim the attention of
some of my sex, who may be able to bring into view, more thoroughly than I have
done, the situation and degradation of woman. I shall now proceed to make a few
remarks on the condition of women in my own country.</structure> 

<structure p="91">During the early part of my
life, my lot was cast among the butterflies of the fashionable world; and of this
class of women, I am constrained to say, both from experience and observation, that
their education is miserably deficient; that they are taught to regard marriage as
the one thing needful, the only avenue to distinction; hence to attract the
notice and win the attentions of men, by their external charms, is the chief
business of fashionable girls. They seldom think that men will be allured by
intellectual acquirements, because they find, that where any mental superiority
exists, a woman is generally shunned and regarded as stepping out of her
‘appropriate sphere,’ which, in their view, is to dress, to dance, to set out to the
best possible advantage her person, to read the novels which inundate the press, and
which do more to destroy her character as a rational creature, than any thing else.
Fashionable women regard themselves, and are regarded by men, as pretty toys or as
mere instruments of pleasure; and the vacuity of mind, the heartlessness, the
frivolity which is the necessary result of this false and debasing estimate of
women, can only be fully understood by those who have mingled in the folly and
wickedness of fashionable life; and who have been called from such pursuits by the
voice of the Lord Jesus, inviting their weary and heavy laden souls to come unto Him
and learn of Him, that they may find something worthy of their immortal spirit, and
their intellectual powers; that they may learn the high and holy purposes of their
creation, and consecrate themselves unto the service of God; and not, as is now the
case, to the pleasure of man.</structure> 

<structure p="92">There is another and much more numerous class in this
country, who are withdrawn by education or circumstances from the circle of
fashionable amusements, but who are brought up with the dangerous and absurd idea,
that marriage is a kind of preferment; and that to be able to keep their husband’s
house, and render his situation comfortable, is the end of her being. Much
that she does and says and thinks is done in reference to this situation; and to be
married is too often held up to the view of girls as the sine qua non of human
happiness and human existence. For this purpose more than for any other, I verily
believe the majority of girls are trained. This is demonstrated by the imperfect
education which is bestowed upon them, and the little pains taken to cultivate their
minds, after they leave school, by the little time allowed them for reading, and by
the idea being constantly inculcated, that although all household concerns should be
attended to with scrupulous punctuality at particular seasons, the improvement of
their intellectual capacities is only a secondary consideration, and may serve as an
occupation to fill up the odds and ends of time. In most families, it is considered
a matter of far more consequence to call a girl off from making a pie, or a pudding,
than to interrupt her whilst engaged in her studies. This mode of training
necessarily exalts, in their view, the animal above the intellectual and spiritual
nature, and teaches women to regard themselves as a kind of machinery, necessary to
keep the domestic engine in order, but of little value as the intelligent companions
of men.</structure> 

<structure p="93">Let no one think, from these remarks, that I regard a knowledge of
housewifery as beneath the acquisition of women. Far from it: I believe that a
complete knowledge of household affairs is an indispensable requisite in a woman’s
education,—that by the mistress of a family, whether married or single, doing her
duty thoroughly and understandingly, the happiness of the family is increased to an
incalculable degree, as well as a vast amount of time and money saved. All I
complain of is, that our education consists so almost exclusively in culinary and
other manual operations. I do long to see the time, when it will no longer be
necessary for women to expend so many precious hours in furnishing ‘a well spread
table,’ but that their husbands will forego some of their accustomed indulgences in
this way, and encourage their wives to devote some portion of their time to mental
cultivation, even at the expense of having to dine sometimes on baked potatoes, or
bread and butter.</structure>

<structure p="94">I believe the sentiment expressed by the author of ‘Live and let
Live,’ is true:</structure> 

<structure q="uncredited"><structure p="95">‘Other things being equal, a woman of the highest mental endowments
will always be the best housekeeper, for domestic economy, is a science that brings
into action the qualities of the mind, as well as the graces of the heart. A quick
perception, judgment, discrimination, decision and order are high attributes of
mind, and are all in daily exercise in the well ordering of a family. If a sensible
woman, an intellectual woman, a woman of genius, is not a good housewife, it is not
because she is either, or all of those, but because there is some deficiency in her
character, or some omission of duty which should make her very humble, instead of
her indulging in any secret self-complacency on account of a certain superiority,
which only aggravates her fault.’</structure></structure> 

<structure p="96">The influence of women over the minds and
character of children of both sexes, is allowed to be far greater than that of men.
This being the case by the very ordering of nature, women should be prepared by
education for the performance of their sacred duties as mothers and as sisters. A
late American writer,[2] speaking on this subject, says in reference to an article
in the Westminster Review:</structure> 

<structure q="uncredited"><structure p="97">‘I agree entirely with the writer in the high
estimate which he places on female education, and have long since been satisfied,
that the subject not only merits, but imperiously demands a thorough
reconsideration. The whole scheme must, in my opinion, be reconstructed. The great
elements of usefulness and duty are too little attended to. Women ought, in my view
of the subject, to approach to the best education now given to men, (I except
mathematics and the classics,) far more I believe than has ever yet been attempted.
Give me a host of educated, pious mothers and sisters, and I will do more to
revolutionize a country, in moral and religious taste, in manners and in social
virtues and intellectual cultivation, than I can possibly do in double or treble the
time, with a similar host of educated men. I cannot but think that the miserable
condition of the great body of the people in all ancient communities, is to be
ascribed in a very great degree to the degradation of women.’</structure></structure>

<structure p="98">There is another way
in which the general opinion, that women are inferior to men, is manifested, that
bears with tremendous effect on the laboring class, and indeed on almost all who are
obliged to earn a subsistence, whether it be by mental or physical exertion—I allude
to the disproportionate value set on the time and labor of men and of women. A man
who is engaged in teaching, can always, I believe, command a higher price for
tuition than a woman—even when he teaches the same branches, and is not in any
respect superior to the woman. This I know is the case in boarding and other schools
with which I have been acquainted, and it is so in every occupation in which the
sexes engage indiscriminately. As for example, in tailoring, a man has twice, or
three times as much for making a waistcoat or pantaloons as a woman, although the
work done by each may be equally good. In those employments which are peculiar to
women, their time is estimated at only half the value of that of men. A woman who
goes out to wash, works as hard in proportion as a wood sawyer, or a coal heaver,
but she is not generally able to make more than half as much by a day’s work.
The low remuneration which women receive for their work, has claimed the attention
of a few philanthropists, and I hope it will continue to do so until some remedy is
applied for this enormous evil. I have known a widow, left with four or five
children, to provide for, unable to leave home because her helpless babes demand her
attention, compelled to earn a scanty subsistence, by making coarse shirts at 12¹⁄₂
cents a piece, or by taking in washing, for which she was paid by some wealthy
persons 12¹⁄₂ cents per dozen. All these things evince the low estimation in which
woman is held. There is yet another and more disastrous consequence arising from
this unscriptural notion—women being educated, from earliest childhood, to regard
themselves as inferior creatures, have not that self-respect which conscious
equality would engender, and hence when their virtue is assailed, they yield to
temptation with facility, under the idea that it rather exalts than debases them, to
be connected with a superior being.</structure> 

<structure p="99">There is another class of women in this country,
to whom I cannot refer, without feelings of the deepest shame and sorrow. I allude
to our female slaves. Our southern cities are whelmed beneath a tide of pollution;
the virtue of female slaves is wholly at the mercy of irresponsible tyrants, and
women are bought and sold in our slave markets, to gratify the brutal lust of those
who bear the name of Christians. In our slave States, if amid all her degradation
and ignorance, a woman desires to preserve her virtue unsullied, she is either
bribed or whipped into compliance, or if she dares resist her seducer, her
life by the laws of some of the slave States may be, and has actually been
sacrificed to the fury of disappointed passion. Where such laws do not exist, the
power which is necessarily vested in the master over his property, leaves the
defenceless slave entirely at his mercy, and the sufferings of some females on this
account, both physical and mental, are intense. Mr. Gholson, in the House of
Delegates of Virginia, in 1832, said, <structure q="Virginia Delegate Gholson, anti-abolitionist">‘He really had been under the impression that
he owned his slaves. He had lately purchased four women and ten children, in whom he
thought he had obtained a great bargain; for he supposed they were his own property,
as were his brood mares.’ But even if any laws existed in the United States, as in
Athens formerly, for the protection of female slaves, they would be null and void,
because the evidence of a colored person is not admitted against a white, in any of
our Courts of Justice in the slave States. ‘In Athens, if a female slave had cause
to complain of any want of respect to the laws of modesty, she could seek the
protection of the temple, and demand a change of owners; and such appeals were never
discountenanced, or neglected by the magistrate.’</structure> In Christian America, the slave
has no refuge from unbridled cruelty and lust.</structure> 

<structure p="100">S. A. Forrall, speaking of the state
of morals at the South, says, ‘Negresses when young and likely, are often employed
by the planter, or his friends, to administer to their sensual desires. This
frequently is a matter of speculation, for if the offspring, a mulatto, be a
handsome female, 800 or 1000 dollars may be obtained for her in the New Orleans
market. It is an occurrence of no uncommon nature to see a Christian father
sell his own daughter, and the brother his own sister.’ The following is copied by
the N. Y. Evening Star from the Picayune, a paper published in New Orleans. ‘A very
beautiful girl, belonging to the estate of John French, a deceased gambler at New
Orleans, was sold a few days since for the round sum of $7,000. An ugly-looking
bachelor named Gouch, a member of the Council of one of the Principalities, was the
purchaser. The girl is a brunette; remarkable for her beauty and intelligence, and
there was considerable contention, who should be the purchaser. She was, however,
persuaded to accept Gouch, he having made her princely promises.’ I will add but one
more from the numerous testimonies respecting the degradation of female slaves, and
the licentiousness of the South. It is from the Circular of the Kentucky Union, for
the moral and religious improvement of the colored race. ‘To the female character
among our black population, we cannot allude but with feelings of the bitterest
shame. A similar condition of moral pollution and utter disregard of a pure and
virtuous reputation, is to be found only without the pale of Christendom. That such
a state of society should exist in a Christian nation, claiming to be the most
enlightened upon earth, without calling forth any particular attention to its
existence, though ever before our eyes and in our families, is a moral phenomenon at
once unaccountable and disgraceful.’ Nor does the colored woman suffer alone: the
moral purity of the white woman is deeply contaminated. In the daily habit of seeing
the virtue of her enslaved sister sacrificed without hesitancy or remorse, she looks
upon the crimes of seduction and illicit intercourse without horror, and
although not personally involved in the guilt, she loses that value for innocence in
her own, as well as the other sex, which is one of the strongest safeguards to
virtue. She lives in habitual intercourse with men, whom she knows to be polluted by
licentiousness, and often is she compelled to witness in her own domestic circle,
those disgusting and heart-sickening jealousies and strifes which disgraced and
distracted the family of Abraham. In addition to all this, the female slaves suffer
every species of degradation and cruelty, which the most wanton barbarity can
inflict; they are indecently divested of their clothing, sometimes tied up and
severely whipped, sometimes prostrated on the earth, while their naked bodies are
torn by the scorpion lash.</structure> 

<structure po="2">
<structure l="1">‘The whip on WOMAN’S shrinking flesh!</structure>
<structure l="2">Our soil yet reddening with the stains</structure> 
<structure l="3">Caught from her scourging warm and fresh.’</structure>
</structure>

<structure p="101">Can any American woman look at these scenes of shocking licentiousness and cruelty, and fold
her hands in apathy, and say, ‘I have nothing to do with slavery’? She cannot and be
guiltless.</structure>

<structure p="102">I cannot close this letter, without saying a few words on the benefits to
be derived by men, as well as women, from the opinions I advocate relative to the
equality of the sexes. Many women are now supported, in idleness and extravagance,
by the industry of their husbands, fathers, or brothers, who are compelled to toil
out their existence, at the counting house, or in the printing office, or some other
laborious occupation, while the wife and daughters and sisters take no part in the
support of the family, and appear to think that their sole business is to
spend the hard bought earnings of their male friends. I deeply regret such a state
of things, because I believe that if women felt their responsibility, for the
support of themselves, or their families it would add strength and dignity to their
characters, and teach them more true sympathy for their husbands, than is now
generally manifested,—a sympathy which would be exhibited by actions as well as
words. Our brethren may reject my doctrine, because it runs counter to common
opinions, and because it wounds their pride; but I believe they would be ‘partakers
of the benefit’ resulting from the Equality of the Sexes, and would find that woman,
as their equal, was unspeakably more valuable than woman as their inferior, both as
a moral and an intellectual being.</structure>

<structure subhead="9">HEROISM OF WOMEN—WOMEN IN AUTHORITY.</structure> 
<structure date="August 25th, 1837">Brookline, 8th Mo. 25th, 1837.</structure>

<structure p="103">My Dear Sister,—It seems necessary to
glance at the conduct of women under circumstances which place them in juxtaposition
with men, although I regard it as entirely unimportant in proving the moral equality
of the sexes; because I condemn, in both, the exercise of that brute force which is
as contrary to the law of God in men as in women; still, as a part of our history, I
shall notice some instances of courage exhibited by females.</structure> 

<structure q="uncredited"><structure p="104">‘Philippa, wife of
Edward III., was the principal cause of the victory gained over the Scots at Neville
Cross. In the absence of her husband, she rode among the troops, and exhorted them
to “be of good courage.”’ Jane, Countess of Mountfort, and a contemporary of
Philippa, likewise possessed a great share of physical courage. The history of Joan
of Arc is too familiar to need repetition. During the reign of James II. a singular
instance of female intrepidity occurred in Scotland. Sir John Cochrane being
condemned to be hung, his daughter twice disguised herself, and robbed the mail that
brought his death warrant. In the mean time, his pardon was obtained from the
King. Instances might be multiplied, but it is unnecessary. I shall therefore close
these proofs of female courage with one more fact. ‘During the revolutionary war,
the women shared in the patriotism and bravery of the men. Several individuals
carried their enthusiasm so far as to enter the army, where they faced all the
perils and fatigues of the camp, until the close of the war.’</structure> 

<structure p="105">When I view my countrywomen in the character of soldiers, or even behold them loading fire arms and
moulding bullets for their brethren to destroy men’s lives, I cannot refrain a sigh.
I cannot but contrast their conduct at that solemn crisis with the conduct of those
women who followed their Lord and Master with unresisting submission, to Calvary’s
Mount. With the precepts and example of a crucified Redeemer, who, in that sublime
precept, ‘Resist not evil,’ has interdicted to his disciples all war and all
violence, and taught us that the spirit of retaliation for injuries, whether in the
camp, or at the fire-side, is wholly at variance with the peaceful religion he came
to promulgate. How little do we comprehend that simple truth, ‘By this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.’</structure>
</structure>

<structure p="106">Women have sometimes distinguished themselves in a way more consistent with their duties as moral beings.
During the war between the Romans and the Sabines, the Sabine women who had been
carried off by the Romans, repaired to the Sabine camp, dressed in deep mourning,
with their little ones in their arms, to soften, if possible, the feelings of their
parents. They knelt at the feet of their relatives; and when Hersilia, the
wife of Romulus, described the kindness of their husbands, and their unwillingness
to be separated from them, their fathers yielded to their entreaties, and an
alliance was soon agreed upon. In consequence of this important service, peculiar
privileges were conferred on women by the Romans. Brutus said of his wife, ‘I must
not answer Portia in the words of Hector, “Mind your wheel, and to your maids give
law,” for in courage, activity and concern for her country’s freedom, she is
inferior to none of us.’ After the fatal battle of Cannæ, the Roman women
consecrated all their ornaments to the service of the state. But when the triumvirs
attempted to tax them for the expenses of carrying on a civil war, they resisted the
innovation. They chose Hortensia for their speaker, and went in a body to the
market-place to expostulate with the magistrates. The triumvirs wished to drive them
away, but they were compelled to yield to the wishes of the people, and give the
women a hearing. Hortensia pleaded so well the cause of her sisters, who resolved
that they would not voluntarily aid in a civil war, that the number of women taxed
was reduced from 1400 to 400.</structure> 

<structure p="107">In the wars of the Guelphs and the Ghibbelines, the
emperor Conrad refused all terms of capitulation to the garrison of Winnisberg, but
he granted the request of the women to pass out in safety with such of their effects
as they could carry themselves. Accordingly, they issued from the besieged city,
each bearing on her shoulders a husband, son, father, or brother. They passed
unmolested through the enemy’s camp, which rung with acclamations of applause.</structure>

<structure p="108">During our struggle for independence, the women were as exemplary as the men in
various instances of self-denial: they refused every article of decoration for their
persons; foreign elegances were laid aside, and they cheerfully abstained from
luxuries for their tables.</structure> 

<structure p="109">English history presents many instances of women
exercising prerogatives now denied them. In an action at law, it has been determined
that an unmarried woman, having a freehold, might vote for members of Parliament;
and it is recorded that lady Packington returned two. Lady Broughton was keeper of
the gatehouse prison. And in a much later period, a woman was appointed governor of
the house of correction at Chelmsford, by order of the court. In the reign of George
II. the minister of Clerkenwell was chosen by a majority of women. The office of
grand chamberlain in 1822 was filled by two women; and that of clerk of the crown,
in the court of king’s bench, has been granted to a female. The celebrated Anne,
countess of Pembroke, held the hereditary office of sheriff of Westmoreland, and
exercised it in person, sitting on the bench with the judges.</structure> 

<structure p="110">I need hardly advert
to the names of Elizabeth of England, Maria Theresa of Germany, Catharine of Russia,
and Isabella of Spain, to prove that women are capable of swaying the sceptre of
royalty. The page of history proves incontestibly, not only that they are as well
qualified to do so as men, but that there has been a comparatively greater
proportion of good queens, than of good kings; women who have purchased their
celebrity by individual strength of character.</structure>  

<structure p="111">I mention these women only to
prove that intellect is not sexed; that strength of mind is not sexed; and that our
views about the duties of men and the duties of women, the sphere of man and the
sphere of woman, are mere arbitrary opinions, differing in different ages and
countries, and dependant solely on the will and judgment of erring mortals.</structure> 

<structure p="112">As moral and responsible beings, men and women have the same sphere of action, and the same
duties devolve upon both; but no one can doubt that the duties of each vary
according to circumstances; that a father and a mother, a husband and a wife, have
sacred obligations resting on them, which cannot possibly belong to those who do not
sustain these relations. But these duties and responsibilities do not attach to them
as men and as women, but as parents, husbands, and wives.</structure>

<structure subhead="10">INTELLECT OF WOMAN.</structure> 
<structure date="August 1837"><setting>Brookline</setting>, 8th Mo.1837</structure>.
<structure p="113">My Dear Sister,—It will scarcely be denied, I presume, that, as a general
rule, <power_system p_patriarchy="men's wishes over women's">men do not desire the improvement of women</power_system>. There are few instances of men who
are magnanimous enough to be entirely willing that women should know more than
themselves, on any subjects except dress and cookery; and, indeed, this necessarily
flows from their assumption of superiority. As they have determined that Jehovah has
placed woman on a lower platform than man, they of course wish to keep her there;
and hence the noble faculties of our minds are crushed, and our reasoning powers are
almost wholly uncultivated.</structure> 

<structure p="114">A writer in the time of Charles I. says—‘She that
knoweth how to compound a pudding, is more desirable than she who skilfully
compounded a poem. A female poet I mislike at all times.’ Within the last century,
it has been gravely asserted that, ‘chemistry enough to keep the pot boiling, and
geography enough to know the location of the different rooms in her house, is
learning sufficient for a woman.’ Byron, who was too sensual to conceive of a
pure and perfect companionship between the sexes, would limit a woman’s library to a
Bible and cookery book. I have myself heard men, who knew for themselves the value
of intellectual culture, say they cared very little for a wife who could not make a
pudding, and smile with contempt at the ardent thirst for knowledge exhibited by
some women.</structure> 

<structure p="115">But all this is miserable wit and worse philosophy. It exhibits that
passion for the gratification of a pampered appetite, which is beneath those who
claim to be so far above us, and may justly be placed on a par with the policy of
the slaveholder, who says that men will be better slaves, if they are not permitted
to learn to read.</structure> 

<structure p="116">In spite, however, of the obstacles which impede the progress of
women towards that state of high mental cultivation for which her Creator prepared
her, the tendency towards the universal dissemination of knowledge has had its
influence on their destinies; and in all ages, a few have surmounted every
hindrance, and proved, beyond dispute, that they have talents equal to their
brethren.</structure> 

<structure p="117">Cornelia, the daughter of Scipio Africanus, was distinguished for virtue,
learning and good sense. She wrote and spoke with uncommon elegance and purity.
Cicero and Quinctilian bestow high praise upon her letters, and the eloquence of her
children was attributed to her careful superintendence. This reminds me of a remark
made by my brother, Thomas S. Grimke, when speaking of the importance of women being
well educated, that ‘educated men would never make educated women, but educated
women would make educated men.’ I believe the sentiment is correct, because
if the wealth of latent intellect among women was fully evolved and improved, they
would rejoice to communicate to their sons all their own knowledge, and inspire them
with desires to drink from the fountain of literature.</structure> 

<structure p="118">I pass over many interesting
proofs of the intellectual powers of women; but I must not omit glancing at the age
of chivalry, which has been compared to a golden thread running through the dark
ages. During this remarkable era, women who, before this period, had been subject to
every species of oppression and neglect, were suddenly elevated into deities, and
worshipped with a mad fanaticism. It is not improbable, however, that even the
absurdities of chivalry were beneficial to women, as it raised them from that
extreme degradation to which they had been condemned, and prepared the way for them
to be permitted to enjoy some scattered rays from the sun of science and literature.
As the age of knight-errantry declined, men began to take pride in learning, and
women shared the advantages which this change produced. ‘Women preached in public,
supported controversies, published and defended theses, filled the chairs of
philosophy and law, harangued the popes in Latin, wrote Greek and read Hebrew. Nuns
wrote poetry, women of rank became divines, and young girls publicly exhorted
Christian princes to take up arms for the recovery of the holy sepulchre. Hypatia,
daughter of Theon of Alexandria, succeeded her father in the government of the
Platonic school, and filled with reputation a seat, where many celebrated
philosophers had taught. The people regarded her as an oracle, and magistrates
consulted her in all important cases. No reproach was ever uttered against the
perfect purity of her manners. She was unembarrassed in large assemblies of men,
because their admiration was tempered with the most scrupulous respect. In the 13th
century, a young lady of Bologna pronounced a Latin oration at the age of
twenty-three. At twenty-six, she took the degree of doctor of laws, and began
publicly to expound Justinian. At thirty, she was elevated to a professor’s chair,
and taught the law to a crowd of scholars from all nations. Italy produced many
learned and gifted women, among whom, perhaps none was more celebrated than Victoria
Colonna, Marchioness of Pescara. In Spain, Isabella of Rosera converted Jews by her
eloquent preaching;’ and in England the names of many women, from Lady Jane Gray
down to Harriet Martineau, are familiar to every reader of history. Of the last
mentioned authoress, Lord Brougham said that her writings on political economy were
doing more good than those of any man in England. There is a contemporary of Harriet
Martineau, who has recently rendered valuable services to her country. She presented
a memorial to Parliament, stating the dangerous parts of the coast, where
light-houses were needed, and at her suggestion, several were erected. She keeps a
life-boat and sailors in her pay, and has been the means of saving many lives.
Although she has been deprived of the use of her limbs since early childhood, yet
even when the storm is unusually severe, she goes herself on the beach in her
carriage, that she may be sure her men perform their duty. She understands several
languages, and is now engaged in writing a work on the Northern languages of
Europe. ‘In Germany, the influence of women on literature is considerable, though
less obvious than in some other countries. Literary families frequently meet at each
others’ houses, and learned and intelligent women are often the brightest ornaments
of these social circles.’ France has produced many distinguished women, whose names
are familiar to every lover of literature. And I believe it is conceded universally,
that Madame de Stael was intellectually the greatest woman that ever lived. The
United States have produced several female writers, some of whom have talents of the
highest order. But women, even in this free republic, do not enjoy all the
intellectual advantages of men, although there is a perceptible improvement within
the last ten or twenty years; and I trust there is a desire awakened in my sisters
for solid acquirements, which will elevate them to their ‘appropriate sphere,’ and
enable them to ‘adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.’</structure>

<structure p="228">I have now, my dear sister, completed my
series of letters. I am aware, they contain some new views; but I believe they are

prayerful consideration of Christians. If they strike at some of our bosom sins, our
deep-rooted prejudices, our long cherished opinions, let us not condemn them on that
account, but investigate them fearlessly and prayerfully</religion>, and not shrink from the
examination; because, if they are true, they place heavy responsibilities upon
women. In throwing them before the public, I have been actuated solely by the
belief, that if they are acted upon, they will exalt the character and enlarge the
usefulness of my own sex, and contribute greatly to the happiness and virtue of the
other. That there is a root of bitterness continually springing up in families and
troubling the repose of both men and women, must be manifest to even a superficial
observer; and I believe it is the mistaken notion of the inequality of the sexes. <power_system p_patriarchy="'Assumption of superiority'">As
there is an assumption of superiority on the one part,</power_system> <f_theory f_enlightenment_individualism="'individual dignity bestowed by 'Jehovah'">which is not sanctioned by

<structure p="229">One word more. I feel that I am calling upon my sex to sacrifice what has been, what is
still dear to their hearts, the adulation, the flattery, the attentions of trifling
men. I am asking them to repel these insidious enemies whenever they approach them;
to manifest by their conduct, that, although they value highly the society of pious
and intelligent men, they have no taste for idle conversation, and for that silly
preference which is manifested for their personal accommodation, often at the
expense of great inconvenience to their male companions. As an illustration of what
I mean, I will state a fact.</structure> 

<structure p="230">I was traveling lately in a stage coach. A gentleman,
who was also a passenger, was made sick by riding with his back to the horses. I
offered to exchange seats, assuring him it did not affect me at all unpleasantly;
but he was too polite to permit a lady to run the risk of being discommoded. I am
sure he meant to be very civil, but I really thought it was a foolish piece of
civility. This kind of attention encourages selfishness in woman, and is only
accorded as a sort of quietus, in exchange for those rights of which we are
deprived. Men and women are equally bound to cultivate a spirit of accommodation;
but I exceedingly deprecate her being treated like a spoiled child, and sacrifices
made to her selfishness and vanity. In lieu of these flattering but injurious
attentions, yielded to her as an inferior, as a mark of benevolence and courtesy, I
want my sex to claim nothing from their brethren but what their brethren may justly
claim from them, in their intercourse as Christians. I am persuaded woman
can do much in this way to elevate her own character. And that we may become duly
sensible of the dignity of our nature, only a little lower than the angels, and
bring forth fruit to the glory and honor of Emanuel’s name, is the fervent prayer of</structure>

        and describe psychological phenomena so vividly that whether his concepts were given 
        names borrowed from physiology, philosophy, or literature – penis envy, ego, Oedipus 
        complex – they seemed to have a concrete physical reality. Psychological facts, as Jones

        phenomena as well as psychological. <s_theory s_freud="sexual science post-freud">In the new view, behavioural scientists do not need to 
        borrow language from physiology to explain psychological events, or give them pseudo-
        reality. Sexual phenomena are no more nor less real than, for instance, the phenomenon of 
        Shakespeare’s writing Hamlet, which cannot exactly be ‘explained’ by reducing it to sexual 
        terms.</s_theory> Even Freud himself cannot be explained by his own deterministic, physiological 
        blueprint though his biographer traces his genius, his ‘divine passion for knowledge’, to an 
        insatiable sexual curiosity, before the age of three, as to what went on between his mother 
        and father in the bedroom.

        <s_theory s_freud="freud and sexual development">Today biologists, social scientists, and increasing numbers of psychoanalysts see the need 
        or impulse to human growth as a primary human need, as basic as sex. The ‘oral’ and ‘anal’ 
        stages which Freud described in terms of sexual development the child gets his sexual 
        pleasure first by mouth, from mother’s breast, then from his bowel movements – are now 
        seen as stages of human growth, influenced by cultural circumstances and parental 
        attitudes as well as by sex. When the teeth grow, the mouth can bite as well as suck. Muscle 
        and brain also grow; the child becomes capable of control, mastery, understanding; and his 
        need to grow and learn, at five, twenty-five, or fifty, can be satisfied, denied, repressed, 
        atrophied, evoked, or discouraged by his culture as can his sexual needs. Child specialists 
        today confirm Freud’s observation that problems between mother and child in the earliest 
        stages are often played out in terms of eating; later in toilet training. And yet in America in 
        recent years there has been a noticeable decline in children’s ‘eating problems’. Has the 
        child’s instinctual development changed? Impossible if, by definition, the oral stage is 
        instinctual. Or has the culture removed eating as a focus for early childhood problems – by 
        the American emphasis on permissiveness in child care, or simply by the fact that in our 
        affluent society food has become less a cause for anxiety in mothers? Because of Freud’s 
        own influence on our culture, educated parents are usually careful not to put conflict-
        producing pressures on toilet training. Such conflicts are more likely to occur today as the

        Since all of Freud’s theories rested, admittedly, on his own penetrating, unending psychoanalysis
        of himself, and since sexuality was the focus of all his theories, certain 
        paradoxes about his own sexuality seem pertinent. His writings, as many scholars have 
        noted, give much more attention to infantile sexuality than to its mature expression. His chief 
        biographer, Jones, pointed out that he was, even for those times, exceptionally chaste, 
        puritanical, and moralistic. In his own life he was relatively uninterested in sex. There were 
        only the adoring mother of his youth, at sixteen a romance that existed purely in fantasy with 
        a girl named Gisele, and his engagement to Martha at twenty-six. The nine months when they 
        both lived in Vienna were not too happy because she was, evidently, uneasy and afraid of 
        him, but separated by a comfortable distance for four years, there was a grande passion of 
        900 love letters. After their marriage, the passion seems to have quickly disappeared, though 
        his biographers note that he was too rigid a moralist to seek sexual satisfaction outside of 
        marriage. The only woman on whom, as an adult, he ever focused the violent passions of 
        love and hate of which he was capable was Martha, during the early years of their 
        engagement. After that, such emotions were focused on men. As Jones, his respectful 
        biographer, said: <structure q="Jones">‘Freud’s deviation from the average in this respect, as well as his

        There can have been few more successful marriages. Martha certainly made an excellent

        however, from either idolators or hostile biographers that he ever sought sexual satisfaction 
        outside his marriage. Thus it would seem that sex was completely divorced from his human 
        passions, which he expressed throughout the productive later years of his long life in his 
        thought and, to a lesser extent, in friendships with men and those women he considered his

        perhaps of the man’, and leads in normal femininity, to the wish for the penis of her husband, 
        a wish that is never really fulfilled until she possesses a penis through giving birth to a son. 
        In short, she is merely an homme manque, a man with something missing.</s_theory> As the eminent

        which supplies the strongest motive force for his further development. The castration-
        complex in the girl, as well, is started by the sight of the genital organs of the other sex. She
        immediately notices the difference and, it must be admitted, its significance. She feels 
        herself at a great disadvantage, and often declares that she would like to have something like

        she lacks a penis does not mean that she accepts its absence lightly. On the contrary, she 
        clings for a long rime to the desire to get something like it, and believes in that possibility for 
        an extraordinary number of years and even at a time when her knowledge of reality has long

        activity (that is, ‘activity such as is usually characteristic of the male’) or to ‘normal
        femininity’, in which the girl’s own impulses to activity are repressed, and she turns to her 
        father in her wish for the penis. ‘The feminine situation is, however, only established when 
        the wish for the penis is replaced by the wish for a child – the child taking the place of the 
        penis.’ When she played with dolls, this ‘was not really an expression of her femininity’, since 
        this was activity, not passivity. The ‘strongest feminine wish’, the desire for a penis, finds real 
        fulfilment only ‘if the child is a little boy, who brings the longed-for penis with him.... The 
        mother can transfer to her son all the ambition she has had to suppress in herself, and she

        many reasons to envy men: the same conditions, in fact, that the feminists fought against. If 
        a woman who was denied the freedom, the status, and the pleasures that men enjoyed
        wished secretly that she could have these things, in the shorthand of the dream, she might 
        wish herself a man and see herself with that one thing which made men unequivocally

        It is recognised now that Freud never gave proper attention, even in man, to growth of the
        ego or self: ‘the impulse to master, control or come to self-fulfilling terms with the 
        environment’. Analysts who have freed themselves from Freud’s bias and joined other 
        behavioural scientists in studying the human need to grow, are beginning to believe that this 
        is the basic human need, and that interference with it, in any dimension, is the source of 
        psychic trouble. The sexual is only one dimension of the human potential. <f_theory f_rad_fem="failiures of the penis envy theory">Freud saw women

        denial of education and independence, prevented women from realising their full potential, 
        or from attaining those interests and ideals that might have stimulated their growth. Freud 
        reported these deficiencies, but could only explain them as the toll of ‘penis envy’. He saw 
        that women who secretly hungered to be man’s equal would not enjoy being his object; and 
        in this, he seemed to be describing a fact. But when he dismissed woman’s yearning for 
        equality as ‘penis envy’, was he not merely stating his own view that women could never

        Freud was not concerned with changing society, but in helping man, and woman, adjust to

        symptom-complex that prevented her from taking any part in life for fifteen years. Freed of 
        these symptoms she ‘plunged into a whirl of activity in order to develop her talents, which 
        were by no means small, and derive a little appreciation, enjoyment, and success from life 
        before it was too late’. But all her attempts ended when she saw that there was no place for 
        her. Since she could no longer relapse into her neurotic symptoms, she began to have 
        accidents; she sprained her ankle, her foot, her hand. When this also was analysed, ‘instead 
        of accidents, she contracted on the same occasions slight illnesses, such as catarrh, sore 
        throat, influenzal conditions or rheumatic swellings, until at last, when she made up her

        done by well-meaning popularisers and inadvertent distorters; by orthodox converts and 
        bandwagon faddists; by those who suffered and those who cured and those who turned 
        suffering to profit; and, above all, by a congruence of forces and needs peculiar to the 
        American people at that particular time. In fact, the literal acceptance in the American 
        culture of Freud’s theory of feminine fulfilment was in tragi-comic contrast to the personal 
        struggle of many American psychoanalysts to reconcile what they saw in their women 
        patients with Freudian theory.</s_theory>

        patients in a way that I was not willing to do. I have come to the conclusion that penis envy 
        simply does not exist. I have seen women who are completely expressive, sexually, vaginally, 
        and yet who are not mature, integrated, fulfilled. I had a woman patient on the couch for 
        nearly two years before I could face her real problem – that it was not enough for her to be 
        just a housewife and mother. One day she had a dream that she was teaching a class. I could 
        not dismiss the powerful yearning of this housewife’s dream, as penis envy. It was the 
        expression of her own need for mature self-fulfilment. I told her: ‘I can’t analyse this dream

        read or heard. To this day, it has not penetrated to the popular culture that the pervasive 
        growing frustration of American women may not be a matter of feminine sexuality. Freud was 
        accepted so quickly and completely at the end of the forties that for over a decade no one 
        even questioned the race of the educated American woman back to the home. When 
        questions finally had to be asked because something was obviously going wrong, they were 
        asked so completely within the Freudian framework that only one answer was possible:

        the very relief it provided from uncomfortable questions about objective realities. After the 
        depression, after the war, Freudian psychology became much more than a science of human 
        behaviour, a therapy for the suffering. It became an all-embracing American ideology, a new 
        religion. It provided a convenient escape from the atom bomb, McCarthy, all the 
        disconcerting problems that might spoil the taste of steaks, and cars and colour television 
        and backyard swimming pools. And if the new psychological religion – which made a virtue 
        of sex, removed all sin from private vice, and cast suspicion on high aspirations of the mind 
        and spirit – had a more devastating personal effect on women than men, nobody planned it

        feminine mystique. It was the creation of writers and editors in the mass media, ad-agency 
        motivation researchers, and behind them the popularisers and translators of Freudian 
        thought in the colleges and universities. Freudian and pseudo-Freudian theories settled 
        everywhere, like fine volcanic ash. Sociology, anthropology, education, even the study of 
        history and literature became permeated and transfigured by Freudian thought. The most 
        zealous missionaries of the feminine mystique were the functionalists, who seized hasty 
        gulps of pre-digested Freud to start their new departments of ‘Marriage and Family-Life 
        Education’. The functional courses in marriage taught American college girls how to ‘play the 
        role’ of woman – the old role became a new science. Related movements outside the 
        colleges – parent education, child-study groups, prenatal maternity study groups and 
        mental-health education – spread the new psychological super-ego throughout the land, 
        replacing bridge and canasta as an entertainment for educated young wives. And this 
        Freudian super-ego worked for growing numbers of young and impressionable American 
        women as Freud said the super-ego works – to perpetuate the past.</f_theory>

            the sound of an insult, yet he is not ashamed of his animal nature; on the contrary, he is
            proud if someone says of him: ‘He is a male!’ <f_theory f_antifeminist="bioessentialism">The term ‘female’ is derogatory not because it
                emphasises woman’s animality, but because it imprisons her in her sex; and if this sex 
                seems to man to be contemptible and inimical even in harmless dumb animals, it is 
                evidently because of the uneasy hostility stirred up in him by woman. Nevertheless he

            callous, lustful, ferocious, abased – man projects them all at once upon woman. And the 
            fact is that she is a female. But if we are willing to stop thinking in platitudes, two questions 
            are immediately posed: <f_theory f_rad_fem="natural vs societal">what does the female denote in the animal kingdom? And what 
                particular kind of female is manifest in woman?</f_theory>
        </structure>
        <structure p="2">
            <s_theory s_natural_rights="natural sexes">Males and females are two types of individuals which are differentiated within a species for 
                the function of reproduction; they can be defined only correlatively. But first it must be noted 
                that even the division of a species into two sexes is not always clear-cut.</s_theory>
        </structure>
        <structure p="3">
            In nature it is not universally manifested. To speak only of animals, it is well known that 
            among the microscopic one-celled forms – infusoria, amoebae, sporozoans, and the like – 
            multiplication is fundamentally distinct from sexuality. Each cell divides and subdivides by 
            itself. In many-celled animals or metazoans reproduction may take place asexually, either 
            by schizogenesis – that is, by fission or cutting into two or more parts which become new 
            individuals – or by blastogenesis – that is, by buds that separate and form new individuals. 
            The phenomena of budding observed in the fresh-water hydra and other coelenterates, in 
            sponges, worms, and tunicates, are well-known examples. In cases of parthenogenesis the 
            egg of the virgin female develops into an embryo without fertilisation by the male, which thus 
            may play no role at all. In the honey-bee copulation takes place, but the eggs may or may not 
            be fertilised at the time of laying. The unfertilised eggs undergo development and produce 
            the drones (males); in the aphids males are absent during a series of generations in which 
            the eggs are unfertilised and produce females. Parthenogenesis has been induced artificially 
            in the sea urchin, the starfish, the frog, and other species. Among the one-celled animals 
            (Protozoa), however, two cells may fuse, forming what is called a zygote; and in the honey-
            bee fertilisation is necessary if the eggs are to produce females. In the aphids both males 
            and females appear in the autumn, and the fertilised eggs then produced are adapted for 
            over-wintering.
        </structure>
        <structure p="4">
            Certain biologists in the past concluded from these facts that even in species capable of 
            asexual propagation occasional fertilisation is necessary to renew the vigour of the race – to 
            accomplish ‘rejuvenation’ through the mixing of hereditary material from two individuals. On 
            this hypothesis sexuality might well appear to be an indispensable function in the most 
            complex forms of life; only the lower organisms could multiply without sexuality, and even 
            here vitality would after a time become exhausted. But today this hypothesis is largely 
            abandoned; research has proved that under suitable conditions asexual multiplication can 
            go on indefinitely without noticeable degeneration, a fact that is especially striking in the 
            bacteria and Protozoa. More and more numerous and daring experiments in 
            parthenogenesis are being performed, and in many species the male appears to be 
            fundamentally unnecessary. Besides, if the value of intercellular exchange were 
            demonstrated, that value would seem to stand as a sheer, unexplained fact. Biology 
            certainly demonstrates the existence of sexual differentiation, but from the point of view of 
            any end to be attained the science could not infer such differentiation from the structure of 
            the cell, nor from the laws of cellular multiplication, nor from any basic phenomenon.
        </structure>
        <structure p="5">
            <s_theory s_natural_rights="scientific sexes">The production of two types of gametes, the sperm and the egg, does not necessarily imply 
                the existence of two distinct sexes; as a matter of fact, egg and sperm – two highly 
                differentiated types of reproductive cells – may both be produced by the same individual. 
                This occurs in normally hermaphroditic species, which are common among plants and are 
                also to be found among the lower animals, such as annelid worms and molluscs.</s_theory> In them 
            reproduction may be accomplished through self-fertilisation or, more commonly, cross-
            fertilisation. Here again certain biologists have attempted to account for the existing state of 
            affairs. Some hold that the separation of the gonads (ovaries and testes) in two distinct 
            individuals represents an evolutionary advance over hermaphroditism; others on the 
            contrary regard the separate condition as primitive, and believe that hermaphroditism 
            represents a degenerate state. These notions regarding the superiority of one system or the 
            other imply the most debatable evolutionary theorising. All that we can say for sure is that 
            these two modes of reproduction coexist in nature, that they both succeed in accomplishing 
            the survival of the species concerned, and that the differentiation of the gametes, like that 
            of the organisms producing them, appears to be accidental. It would seem, then, that the 
            division of a species into male and female individuals is simply an irreducible fact of 
            observation.
        </structure>
        <structure p="6">
            In most philosophies this fact has been taken for granted without pretence of explanation. 
            <religion r_greekmyth="Platonic myth">According to the Platonic myth, there were at the beginning men, women, and 
                hermaphrodites. Each individual had two faces, four arms, four legs, and two conjoined 
                bodies. At a certain time they were split in two, and ever since each half seeks to rejoin its 
                corresponding half. Later the gods decreed that new human beings should be created 
                through the coupling of dissimilar halves. But it is only love that this story is intended to 
                explain; division into sexes is assumed at the outset.</religion> Nor does Aristotle explain this division, 
            for if matter and form must cooperate in all action, there is no necessity for the active and 
            passive principles to he separated in two different categories of individuals. <religion r_catholicism="St Thomas theory">Thus St Thomas 
                proclaims woman an ‘incidental’ being, which is a way of suggesting – from the male point 
                of view – the accidental or contingent nature of sexuality.</religion> <s_theory s_natural_rights="sexual belonging">Hegel, however, would have been 
                    untrue to his passion for rationalism had he failed to attempt a logical explanation. Sexuality 
                    in his view represents the medium through which the subject attains a concrete sense of 
                    belonging to a particular kind (genre). ‘The sense of kind is produced in the subject as an 
                    effect which offsets this disproportionate sense of his individual reality, as a desire to find 
                    the sense of himself in another individual of his species through union with this other, 
                    to complete himself and thus to incorporate the kind (genre) within his own nature and bring 
                    it into existence. This is copulation’ (Philosophy of Nature, Part 3, Section 369). And a little 
                    farther on. ‘The process consists in this, namely: that which they are in themselves, that is 
                    to say a single kind, one and the same subjective life, they also establish it as such.’ And 
                    Hegel states later that for the uniting process to be accomplished, there must first be sexual 
                    differentiation. But his exposition is not convincing: one feels in it all too distinctly the 
                    predetermination to find in every operation the three terms of the syllogism.</s_theory>
        </structure>
        <structure p="7">
            The projection or transcendence of the individual towards the species, in which both 
            individual and species are fulfilled, could be accomplished without the intervention of a third 
            element in the simple relation of progenitor to offspring; that is to say, reproduction could be 
            asexual. Or, if there were to be two progenitors, they could be similar (as happens in 
            hermaphroditic species) and differentiated only as particular individuals of a single type. 
            Hegel’s discussion reveals a most important significance of sexuality, but his mistake is 
            always to argue from significance to necessity, to equate significance with necessity. <s_theory s_rights_of_man="sexual significance">Man 
                gives significance to the sexes and their relations through sexual activity, just as he gives 
                sense and value to all the functions that he exercises; but sexual activity is not necessarily 
                implied in the nature of the human being.</s_theory> <s_theory s_natural_rights="human existence">Merleau-Ponty notes in the Phénoménologie de la 
                    perception that human existence requires us to revise our ideas of necessity and 
                    contingence. ‘Existence,’ he says, ‘has no casual, fortuitous qualities, no content that does 
                    not contribute to the formation of its aspect; it does not admit the notion of sheer fact, for it 
                    is only through existence that the facts are manifested.’</s_theory> True enough. But it is also true that 
            there are conditions without which the very fact of existence itself would seem to be 
            impossible. <s_theory s_natural_rights="material body">To be present in the world implies strictly that there exists a body which is at 
                once a material thing in the world and a point of view towards this world; but nothing requires 
                that this body have this or that particular structure.</s_theory> <s_theory s_rights_of_man="man as mortal">Sartre discusses in L’Étre et le 
                    néant Heidegger’s dictum to the effect that the real nature of man is bound up with death 
                    because of man’s finite state. He shows that an existence which is finite and yet unlimited in 
                    time is conceivable; but none the less if death were not resident in human life, the relation 
                    of man to the world and to himself would be profoundly disarranged – so much so that the 
                    statement ‘Man is mortal’ would be seen to have significance quite other than that of a mere 
                    fact of observation. Were he immortal, an existent would no longer be what we call a man.
                    One of the essential features of his career is that the progress of his life through time creates 
                    behind him and before him the infinite past and future, and it would seem, then, that the 
                    perpetuation of the species is the correlative of his individual limitation.</s_theory> <s_theory s_natural_rights="nature of being">Thus we can regard 
                        the phenomenon of reproduction as founded in the very nature of being. But we must stop 
                        there. The perpetuation of the species does not necessitate sexual differentiation. True 
                        enough, this differentiation is characteristic of existents to such an extent that it belongs in 
                        any realistic definition of existence. But it nevertheless remains true that both a mind without 
                        a body and an immortal man are strictly inconceivable, whereas we can imagine a 
                        parthenogenetic or hermaphroditic society.</s_theory>

            At the end of the seventeenth century Harvey killed female dogs shortly after copulation and 
            found in the horns of the uterus small sacs that he thought were eggs but that were really 
            embryos. The Danish anatomist Steno gave the name of ovaries to the female genital glands, 
            previously called ‘feminine testicles’, and noted on their surface the small swellings that von 
            Graaf in 1677 erroneously identified with the eggs and that are now called Graafian follicles. 
            The ovary was still regarded as homologous to the male gland. In the same year, however, 
            the ‘spermatic animalcules’ were discovered and it was proved that they penetrated into the 
            uterus of the female; but it was supposed that they were simply nourished therein and that 
            the coming individual was preformed in them. <power_system p_patriarchy="women as passive">In 1694 a Dutchman, Hartsaker, drew a picture 
                of the ‘homunculus’ hidden in the spermatozoan, and in 1699, another scientist said that he 
                had seen the spermatozoan cast off a kind of moult under which appeared a little man, 
                which he also drew. Under these imaginative hypotheses, woman was restricted to the 
                nourishment of an active, living principle already preformed in perfection.</power_system> These notions 
            were not universally accepted, and they were argued into the nineteenth century. The use of 
            the microscope enabled von Baer in 1827 to discover the mammalian egg, contained inside 
            the Graaflan follicle. Before long it was possible to study the cleavage of the egg – that is, the 
            early stage of development through cell division – and in 1835 sarcode, later called 
            protoplasm, was discovered and the true nature of the cell began to be realised. In 1879 the 
            penetration of the spermatozoan into the starfish egg was observed, and thereupon the 
            equivalence of the nuclei of the two gametes, egg and sperm, was established. The details 
            of their union within the fertilised egg were first worked out in 1883 by a Belgian zoologist, 
            van Beneden.
        </structure>
        <structure p="10">
            Aristotle’s ideas were not wholly discredited, however. <power_system p_patriarchy="women as passive">Hegel held that the two sexes were of 
                necessity different, the one active and the other passive, and of course the female would be 
                the passive one. ‘Thus man, in consequence of that differentiation, is the active principle 
                while woman is the passive principle because she remains undeveloped in her 
                unity.’ [Hegel, Philosophy of Nature] And even after the egg had been recognised as an active 
                principle, men still tried to make a point of its quiescence as contrasted with the lively 
                movements of the sperm.</power_system> Today one notes an opposite tendency on the part of some 
            scientists. The discoveries made in the course of experiments on parthenogenesis have led 
            them to reduce the function of the sperm to that of a simple physico-chemical reagent. <power_system p_matriarchy="reproduction without men">It 
                has been shown that in certain species the stimulus of an acid or even of a needle-prick is 
                enough to initiate the cleavage of the egg and the development of the embryo. On this basis 
                it has been boldly suggested that the male gamete (sperm) is not necessary for reproduction, 
                that it acts at most as a ferment; further, that perhaps in time the co-operation of the male 
                will become unnecessary in procreation – the answer, it would seem, to many a woman’s 
                prayer.</power_system> But there is no warrant for so bold an expectation, for nothing warrants us in 
            universalising specific life processes. The phenomena of asexual propagation and of 
            parthenogenesis appear to be neither more nor less fundamental than those of sexual 
            reproduction. I have said that the latter has no claim a priori to be considered basic; but 
            neither does any fact indicate that it is reducible to any more fundamental mechanism.
        </structure>
        <structure p="11">
            Thus, admitting no a priori doctrine, no dubious theory, we are confronted by a fact for which 
            we can offer no basis in the nature of things nor any explanation through observed data, and 
            the significance of which we cannot comprehend a priori. <identity gender="sceintific definition of women">We can hope to grasp the 
                significance of sexuality only by studying it in its concrete manifestations; and then perhaps 
                the meaning of the word female will stand revealed.</identity>
        </structure>
        <structure p="12">
            I do not intend to offer here a philosophy of life; and I do not care to take sides prematurely 
            in the dispute between the mechanistic and the purposive or teleological philosophies. It is 
            to be noted, however, that all physiologists and biologists use more or less finalistic 
            language, if only because they ascribe meaning to vital phenomena. I shall adopt their 
            terminology without taking any stand on the relation between life and consciousness, we 
            can assert that every biological fact implies transcendence, that every function involves a 
            project, something to be done. Let my words be taken to imply no more than that.

        <structure p="paragraph">"Women of the World Unite-We Have Nothing to Lose But Our Men!" Off
            hand, I'd say that's quite a lot. Not so, however, according to New York Women's
            Liberation, who last Saturday, September 7 staged a demonstration on Atlantic City's
            boardwalk to protest the crowning of Miss America 1968, <power_system
                p_patriarchy="patriarchy">"symbol of the American woman's built-in
                obsolescence."</power_system></structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The demonstration began at 3:00 in the afternoon in front of the
            Atlantic City Convention Hall. Women's Liberation, its participants numbering around
            200, began with a march, interrupted almost immediately by <power_system
                p_political="police">police vigilance</power_system>, hecklers and Pageant
            organizers. Placards read "Miss America is alive and angry in Harlem," "Welcome to the
            <power_system p_patriarchy="patriarchy">Miss America Cattle Auction</power_system>,"
            and "Everyone is beautiful," while demonstrators chanted, <power_system p_patriarchy="patriarchy">"Atlantic City is a town with
                class, they raise your morals and judge your ass."</power_system> </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">Hecklers on the other side of the police barricades retorted with
            "Do you play around with monkeys or men?" and "You wouldn't even make it in a woman's
            world." Although the majority of the spectators were hostile, one middle-aged man
            commented, "I think there's some truth, some factuality in their arguments." Jeers
            ranged from "<identity sexuality="lesbian">lesbians></identity>" and "screwy frustrated
            women" to <power_system p_patriarchy="patriarchy">"If they were to get married, they
                wouldn't have time for all this," </power_system> (many of Women's Liberation are
            married) and "If they want freedom, let them join the Service." A little group set up
            its own counter- demonstration, with posters of "Jealousy will get you nowhere." Terry
            Neeuwsen, Miss Green Bay 1967 and runner-up number two in the 1967 Pageant, emerged from
            the crowd wearing a sign, "There's only one thing wrong with Miss America-she's
            beautiful." </structure>
        <structure header="header">Fuzzy Technicality</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The action really began later in the afternoon when one of Women's
            Liberation lead a little wooly lamb onto the boardwalk, with a blue-and-yellow Miss
            America banner draped on its back. The lamb trotted along amicably, but even the big bow
            judiciously strapped to its tail couldn't hide the fact that Women's Liberation Miss
            America 1968 was a male, and on discovery of this fact the crowd hooted and roared.
            Robin Morgan, organizer of the demonstration, attired the lamb in a black padded bra and
            hair-switch.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">Then came a huge Freedom Trash Can, into which Women's Liberation
            dropped items of its purported enslavement-bras, stockings, girdles, hair-curlers,
            copies of Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Ladies' Home Journal. Even the lamb was divested of
            its garb and let loose to wander in its original state.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">Next came an eight-foot wooden puppet with movable joints who
            looked like the female version of-' Uncle Sam, and had chained to it several girls who
            were "auctioned off by Peggy Dobbins, dressed in a grey oversized man's coat, big
            rubbers, tie, trousers and a white <power_system p_race="black">slave trader's
                hat</power_system>, to represent an <power_system p_race="slavery">"auctioneer
                    slave-trader."</power_system> She gave a dialogue on the rights of women in much the
            same manner as that of the original suffragettes, after whom Women's Liberation seems to
            model itself.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The demonstration's ranks dwindled a little at suppertime when
            girls went to eat at a <identity race="black">Black Community open-house</identity>
            arranged by Flo Kennedy.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The Pageant itself began at 8:30 with contestants nervously
            strutting along the platform and a diligent contingent of <power_system
                p_political="police">policewomen</power_system>, troopers and plainclothesmen
            following around the 16 or so members of the Women's Liberation who had tickets for the
            ceremony. Around 10:30 a very peculiar odor started to permeate the main room and
            corridors of the Convention Hall and obviously wafted its way to the noses of police who
            arrested Peggy Dobbins as she . came down the Pageant room steps spraying a Toni
            hair-spray bottle filled with butric acid. The Pageant continued with the contestants
            doing their routines, reminiscent of a Saturday afternoon talent show for 12- year-olds. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">Eighteen-year-old Judith Ann Ford, Miss Illinois, was crowned Miss
            America at 12:00 midnight. She hadn't uttered three words of her acceptance speech, when
            a burst of "Down with Miss America," "Freedom" and "Women's Liberation" echoed from the
            right wing of the Convention Hall balcony. A large white bedsheet with the words
            "Women's Liberation" had been hung over the balcony railing in full view. Police on the
            Convention floor brandishing billyclubs ran up the stairs to the balcony section and
            carried away the six girls who had lowered the banner. One girl who was slow in moving
            was carried off with a policeman's hand around her throat and another hand over her
            mouth.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">"They're expressing freedom, I guess," remarked Saundra Williams,
            19-year-old winner of the <identity race="black">Miss Black America Beauty
                Pageant</identity>, the first of its kind, held the same day in Atlantic City on the
            boardwalk. "To each his own."</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The demonstration outside the Convention Hall, which was continuing
            with a candlelight vigil, was ordered to disperse and "escorted" down the boardwalk by
            Atlantic City police and jeering Pageant participants. The group, after some delay and
            much harassment, finally boarded a city bus and was taken to a terminal on the outskirts
            of town to await its own chartered bus. It was learned meanwhile that Peggy Dobbins had
            been charged with disorderly conduct on a $1,000 bail and the girls who had lowered the
            banner with $110 each.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">Officials of the group then went to the centra] police station
            where, through the arrangements of Flo Kennedy and a Philadelphia woman lawyer who had

            The Story of O, by Pauline Reage, incorporates, along with all literary pornography, principles 
            and characters already isolated in my discussion of children's fairy tales. The <identity gender="female">female</identity> as a 
            figure of innocence and evil enters the adult world--the brutal world of genitalia. The <identity gender="female">female </identity>
            manifests in her adult form--cunt. She emerges defined by the hole between her legs. In 
            addition, Story of O is more than simple pornography. <f_theory f_antifeminist="epistemological">It claims to define epistemologically 
                what a woman is, what she needs, her processes of thinking and feeling, her proper place.</f_theory> It 
            links men and women in an erotic dance of some magnitude: the sado-masochistic 
            complexion of O is not trivial--<f_theory f_antifeminist="natural basis">it is formulated as a cosmic principle which articulates, 
                absolutely, the feminine.</f_theory>
        </structure>
        <structure p="2">
            Also, O is particularly compelling for me because I once believed it to be what its defenders 
            claim--the mystical revelation of the true, eternal, and sacral destiny of <identity>women</identity>. The book 
            was absorbed as a pulsating, erotic, <religion r_christianity="compares to christianity">secular Christianity</religion> (the joy in pure suffering, woman as 
            Christ figure). I experienced O with the same infantile abandon as the NEWSWEEK reviewer 
            who wrote: "What lifts this fascinating book above mere perversity is its movement toward 
            the transcendence of the self through a gift of the self . . . to give the body, to allow it to be 
            ravaged, exploited, and totally possessed can be an act of consequence, if it is done with 
            love for the sake of love." <structure fnote="Newsweek, March 21, 1966, p. 108, unsigned.">1</structure> Any clear-headed appraisal of O will show the situation, O's 
            condition, her behavior, and most importantly her attitude toward her oppressor as a logical 
            scenario incorporating <religion r_judaism="Judeo-Christian">Judeo</religion>-<religion r_christianity="Judeo-Christian">Christian</religion> values of service and self-sacrifice and universal 
            notions of womanhood, <class social="all oppressed peoples">a logical scenario demonstrating the psychology of submission and 
                self-hatred found in all oppressed peoples</class>. O is a book of astounding political significance.
        </structure>
        <structure p="3">
            This is, then, the story of O: O is taken by her lover Rene to Roissy and cloistered there; she 
            is fucked, sucked, raped, whipped, humiliated, and tortured on a regular and continuing 
            basis--she is programmed to be an erotic slave, Rene's personal whore; after being properly 
            trained she is sent home with her lover; her lover gives her to Sir Stephen, his half-brother; 
            she is fucked, sucked, raped, whipped, humiliated, and tortured on a regular and continuing 
            basis; she is ordered to become the lover of Jacqueline and to recruit her for Roissy, which 
            she does; she is sent to Anne-Marie to be branded with Sir Stephen's mark and to have rings 
            with his insignia inserted in her cunt; she serves as an erotic model for Jacqueline's younger 
            sister Natalie who is infatuated with her; she is taken to a party masked as an owl, led on a 
            leash by Natalie, and there plundered, despoiled, raped, gangbanged; realizing that there is 
            nothing else left for Sir Stephen to do with her or to her, fearing that he will abandon her, she 
            asks his permission to kill herself and receives it. Q.E.D., pornography is never big on plot.
        </structure>
        <structure p="4">
            Of course, like most summaries, the above is somewhat sketchy. I have not mentioned the 
            quantities of cock that O sucks, or the anal assaults that she sustains, or the various rapes 
            and tortures perpetrated on her by minor characters in the book, or the varieties of whips 
            used, or described her clothing or the different kinds of nipple rouge, or the many ways in 
            which she is chained, or the shapes and colors of the welts on her body.
        </structure>
        <structure p="5"> 
            From the course of O's story emerges a clear mythological figure: <power_system p_patriarchy="submission of women">she is woman, and to name 
                her O, zero, emptiness, says it all. Her ideal state is one of complete passivity, nothingness, 
                a submission so absolute that she transcends human form</power_system> (in becoming an owl). Only the 
            hole between her legs is left to define her, and the symbol of that hole must surely be O. 
            Much, however, even in the rarefied environs of pornography, necessarily interferes with the 
            attainment of utter passivity. <f_theory f_enlightenment_individualism="women as an individual">Given a body which takes up space, has needs, makes 
                demands, is connected, even symbolically, to a personal history which is a sequence of 
                likes, dislikes, skills, opinions, one is formed, shaped--one exists at the very least as positive 
                space.</f_theory> And since in addition as a woman one is born guilty and carnal, personifying the sins 
            of <religion r_christianity="Adam and Eve">Eve</religion> and <religion r_greekmyth="Pandora's box">Pandora</religion>, the wickedness of <religion r_judaism="Queen of Israel">Jezebel</religion> and Lucretia Borgia, O's transcendence of the 
            species is truly phenomenal.
        </structure>
        <structure p="6">
            The thesis of O is simple. <power_system p_patriarchy="belief in natural sexuality and submission">Woman is cunt, lustful, wanton. She must be punished, tamed, 
                debased. She gives the gift of herself, her body, her well-being, her life, to her lover. This is as 
                it should be--natural and good.</power_system> It ends necessarily in her annihilation, which is also natural 
            and good, as well as beautiful, because she fulfills her destiny:
        </structure>
        <structure p="7">
            As long as I am beaten and ravished on your behalf, I am naught but the thought of you, the 
            desire of you, the obsession of you. That, I believe, is what you wanted. Well, I love you, and 
            that is what I want too. <structure fnote="Pauline Reage, Story of O (New York: Grove Press, 1965), p. xxi.">2</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="8">
            Then let him take her, if only to wound her! O hated herself for her own desire, and loathed 
            Sir Stephen for the self-control he was displaying. She wanted him to love her, there, the truth 
            was out: she wanted him to be chafing under the urge to touch her lips and penetrate her 
            body, to devastate her if need be. . . . <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 80.">3</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="9">
            . . . Yet he was certain that she was guilty and, without really wanting to, Rene was punishing 
            her for a sin he knew nothing about (since it remained completely internal), although Sir 
            Stephen had immediately detected it: her wantonness. <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 93.">4</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="10">
            . . . no pleasure, no joy, no figment of her imagination could ever compete with the happiness 
            she felt at the way he used her with such utter freedom, at the notion that he could do
            anything with her, that there was no limit, no restriction in the manner with which, on her 
            body, he might search for pleasure. <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 187.">5</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="11">
            O is totally possessed. That means that she is an object, with no control over her own 
            mobility, capable of no assertion of personality. Her body is a body, in the same way that a 
            pencil is a pencil, a bucket is a bucket, or, as Gertrude Stein pointedly said, a rose is a rose. 
            It also means that O's energy, or power, as a woman, as Woman, is absorbed. <power_system p_patriarchy=" biological and spiritual power transfer">Possession 
                here denotes a biological transference of power which brings with it a commensurate 
                spiritual strength to the possessor. O does more than offer herself; she is herself the offering.</power_system> 
            To offer herself would be <religion r_christianity="non-poetic sacrifice">prosaic Christian self-sacrifice</religion>, but as the offering she is the vehicle 
            of the miraculous--she incorporates the divine.

        <structure p="12">
            Here sacrifice has its ancient, primal meaning: that which was given at the beginning 
            becomes the gift. The first fruits of the harvest were dedicated to and consumed by the 
            vegetation spirit which provided them. The destruction of the victim in human or animal 
            sacrifice or the consumption of the offering was the very definition of the sacrifice--death 
            was necessary because the victim was or represented the life-giving substance, the vital 
            energy source, which had to be liberated, which only death could liberate. An actual death, 
            the sacrifice per se, not only liberated benevolent energy but also ensured a propagation and 
            increase of life energy (concretely expressed as fertility) by a sort of magical ecology, a 
            recycling of basic energy, or raw power. O's victimization is the confirmation of her power, a 
            power which is transcendental and which has as its essence the sacred processes of life, 
            death, and regeneration.

            But the full significance of possession, both mystically and mythologically, is not yet clear. 
            In mystic experience communion (wrongly called possession sometimes) has meant the 
            dissolution of the ego, the entry into ecstasy, union with and illumination of the godhead. The 
            experience of communion has been the province of the mystic, prophet, or visionary, those 
            who were able to alchemize their energy into pure spirit and this spirit into a state of grace. 
            Possession, rightly defined, is the perversion of the mystic experience; it is by its very nature 
            demonic because its goal is power, its means are violence and oppression. It spills the blood 
            of its victim and in doing so estranges itself from life-giving union. O's lover thinks that she 
            gives herself freely but if she did not, he would take her anyway. Their relationship is the 
            incarnation of demonic possession:
        </structure>
        <structure p="14">
            Thus he would possess her as a god possesses his creatures, whom he lays hold of in the 
            guise of a monster or bird, of an invisible spirit or a state of ecstasy. He did not wish to leave 
            her. The more he surrendered her, the more he would hold her dear. <power_system p_patriarchy="ownership and control">The fact that he gave her 
                was to him a proof, and ought to be for her as well, that she belonged to him: one can only 
                give what belongs to you. He gave her only to reclaim her immediately, to reclaim her 
                enriched in his eyes, like some common object which had been used for some divine 
                purpose and has thus been consecrated. For a long time he had wanted to prostitute her, 
                and he was delighted to feel that the pleasure he was deriving was even greater than he had 
                hoped, and that it bound him to her all the more so because, through it, she would be more 
                humiliated and ravished. Since she loved him, she could not help loving whatever derived 
                from him.</power_system> <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 32.">6</structure>
        </structure>
        <structure p="15">
            <class working_class="sex work">A precise corollary of possession is prostitution. The prostitute, the woman as object, is 
                defined by the usage to which the possessor puts her. Her subjugation is the signet of his 
                power. Prostitution means for the woman the carnal annihilation of will and choice, but for 
                the man it once again signifies an increase in power, pure and simple.</class> To call the power of 
            the possessor, which he demonstrates by playing superpimp, divine, or to confuse it with 
            ecstasy or communion, is to grossly misunderstand. "All the mouths that had probed her 
            mouth, all the hands that had seized her breasts and belly, all the members that had been 
            thrust into her had so perfectly provided the living proof that she was worthy of being 
            prostituted and had, so to speak, sanctified her." <structure fnote="Ibid., p. 106.">7</structure> Of course, it is not O who is sanctified, 
            but Rene, or Sir Stephen, or the others, through her.
        </structure>
        <structure p="16">
            O's prostitution is a vicious caricature of old-world religious prostitution. The ancient sacral 
            prostitution of the <religion r_judaism="Jewish Prostitution">Hebrews</religion>, <religion r_greekmyth="Greek Prostitution">Greeks</religion>, <religion r_non_western="Hindu Prostitution">Indians</religion>, et al., was the ritual expression of respect and 
            veneration for the powers of fertility and generation. <power_system p_religion="Religion and Prostitution">The priestesses/prostitutes of the 
                temple were literal personifications of the life energy of the earth goddess, and transferred 
                that energy to those who participated in her rites. The cosmic principles, articulated as 
                divine male and divine female, were ritually united in the temple because clearly only 
                through their continuing and repeated union could the fertility of the earth and the well-being 
                of a people be ensured. Sacred prostitution was "nothing less than an act of communion 
                with god (or godhead) and was as remote from sensuality as the Christian act of communion 
                is remote from gluttony."</power_system> <structure fnote="Robert S. de Ropp, Sex Energy: The Sexual Force in Man and Animals (New York: Dell Publishing Company, 1969), p. 134.">8</structure> O and all of the women at Roissy are distinguished by their sterility 
            and bear no resemblance whatsoever to any known goddess. No mention is ever made of 
            conception or menstruation, and procreation is never a consequence of fucking. O's fertility 
            has been rendered O. There is nothing sacred about O's prostitution.
        </structure>
        <structure p="17">
            <power_system p_patriarchy="Initiation into Manhood">O's degradation is occasioned by the male need for and fear of initiation into manhood. 
                Initiation rites generally include a period of absolute solitude, isolation, followed by tests of 
                physical courage, mental endurance, often through torture and physical mutilation, resulting 
                in a permanent scar or tattoo which marks the successful initiate. The process of initiation 
                is designed to reveal the values, rites, and rules of manhood and confers on the initiate the 
                responsibilities and privileges of manhood.</power_system> What occurs at Roissy is a clear perversion of 
            real initiation. Rene and the others mutilate O's body, but they are themselves untouched. 
            Her body substitutes for their bodies. O is marked with the scars which they should bear. She 
            undergoes their ordeal for them, endures the solitude and isolation, the torture, the 
            mutilation. In trying to become gods, they have bypassed the necessary rigors of becoming 
            men. The fact that the tortures must be repeated endlessly, not only on O but on large 
            numbers of women who are forced as well as persuaded, demonstrates that the men of 
            Roissy never in fact become men, are never initiates, never achieve the security of realized 
            manhood.
        </structure>
        <structure p="18">
            <power_system p_patriarchy="Male ownership in marriage">What would be the sign of the initiate, the final mark or scar, manifests in the case of O as an 
                ultimate expression of sadism. The rings through O's cunt with Sir Stephen's name and 
                heraldry, and the brand on her ass, are permanent wedding rings rightly placed. They mark 
                her as an owned object and in no way symbolize the passage into maturity and freedom. The 
                same might be said of the conventional wedding ring.</power_system>
        </structure>
        <structure p="19">
            <power_system p_social="heteronormativity">O, in her never-ending role as surrogate everything, also is the direct sexual link between Sir 
                Stephen and Rene. That the two men love each other and fuck each other through O is made 
                clear by the fact that Sir Stephen uses O anally most of the time. The consequences of 
                misdirecting sexual energy are awesome indeed.</power_system>
        </structure>
        <structure p="20">
            But what is most extraordinary about Story of O is the mind-boggling literary style of Pauline 
            Reage, its author. O is wanton yet pure, Sir Stephen is cruel yet kind, Rene is brutal yet gentle, 
            a wall is black yet white. Everything is what it is, what it isn't, and its direct opposite. That 
            technique, which is so skillfully executed, might help to account for the compelling 
            irrationality of Story of O. For those women who are convinced yet doubtful, attracted yet 
            repelled, there is this schema for self-protection: the double-double think that the author 
            engages in is very easy to deal with if we just realize that we only have to double-double 
            unthink it.
        </structure>
        <structure p="21">
            <power_system p_patriarchy="Men possess power over all women">To sum up, Story of O is a story of psychic cannibalism, demonic possession, a story which 
                posits men and women as being at opposite poles of the universe--the survival of one 
                dependent on the absolute destruction of the other. It asks, like many stories, who is the 
                most powerful, and it answers: men are, literally over women's dead bodies.</power_system>

            <identity gender="man">men</identity>, and tried to build a politics based only on
            feelings--the area traditionally left to <identity gender="woman">women</identity>. The
            philosophy has been, "if it feels good, it's O.K. If not, forget it." But that is like

        <structure p="paragraph">The women's liberation movement has produced a deluge of books and
            articles. Their major task has been exposition and criticism of our <power_system
                p_patriarchy="male-centered">male-centered heritage</power_system>. In order to
            reveal and drive home to readers the oppressive character of our cultural institutions,
            it was necessary to do careful research, to trot out passages from leading philosophers,
            psychologists, statesmen, poets, historians, saints and theologians which make the
            reader's hair stand on end by the blatancy of their misogynism. Part of the task also
            has been the tracing of the subtle psychological mechanisms by which society has held
            men up and women down. This method of exposition and analysis reached its crescendo
            within this past year when Kate Millet's Sexual Politics rocketed her into the role of
            American counterpart to Simone de Beauvoir. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">As far as the level of creative research is concerned, that phase
            of the work is finished. The skeletons in our cultural closet have been hauled out for
            inspection. I do not mean to imply that there are not countless more of the same to be
            uncovered (just the other day I noticed for the first time that Berdyaev blandly affirms
            <power_system p_patriarchy="women as worse and lesser">there is something base and
                sinister in the female element</power_system> ." Etcetera). Nor do I mean that the
            task of communicating the message is over. Millions have yet to hear the news, let alone
            to grasp its import. Certainly it would be a mistake and a betrayal to trivialize the
            fact that our culture is so diseased. That has always been a major tactic in the fine
            art of suppressing the rage of women. No, what I am saying is that Phase One of critical
            research and writing in the movement has opened the way for the logical next step in
            creative thinking. We now have to ask how the women's revolution can and should change
            our whole vision of reality. What I intend to do here is to sketch some of the ways in
            which it can influence Western religious thought. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The <religion r_judaism="judeochristian"
                >Judaic</religion>-<religion r_christianity="judeochristian"
                    >Christian</religion>tradition has served to legitimate sexually unbalanced patriarchal
            society. Thus, for example, the image of the Father God, spawned in the human
            imagination and sustained as plausible by patriarchy, has in turn rendered service to
            this type of society by making its mechanisms for the oppression of women appear right
            and fitting. <power_system p_religion="god legitimizing patriarchy">If God in "his"
                heaven is a father ruling "his" people, then it is in the "nature" of things and
                according to divine plan and the order of the universe that society be
                male-dominated.</power_system> Theologian Karl Barth found it appropriate to write
            that <power_system p_patriarchy="women as lesser">woman is "ontologically" subordinate
                to man.</power_system> Within this context a mystification of roles takes place: the
            husband dominating his wife represents God himself. What is happening, of course, is the
            familiar mechanism by which the images and values of a given society are projected into
            'a realm of beliefs, which in turn justify the social infrastructure. The belief system
            becomes hardened and objectified, seeming to have an unchangeable independent existence
            and validity of its own. It resists social change which would rob it of its
            plausibility. Nevertheless, despite the vicious circle, change does occur in society,
            and ideologies die. though they die hard. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">As the women's revolution begins to have its effect upon the fabric
            of society, transforming it from patriarchy into something that never existed
            before—into a diarchal situation that is radically new—it will, I believe, become
            <religion r_christianity="christianity under threat">the greatest single potential
                challenge to Christianity </religion> to rid itself of its oppressive tendencies or
            go out of business. Beliefs and values that have held sway for thousands of years will
            be questioned as never before. It is also very possibly the greatest single hope for
            survival of religious consciousness in the West. </structure>
        
        <structure p="paragraph">At this point it is important to consider the objection that the
            liberation of women will only mean that new characters will assume the same old roles,
            but that nothing will change essentially in regard to structure, ideology, or values.
            This objection is often based upon the observation that the very few women in
            "masculine" occupations seem to behave very much as men do. This is really not to the
            point for it fails to recognize that the effect of tokenism is not to change stereotypes
            or social systems but to preserve these. What I am discussing here is an emergence of
            women such as has never taken place before. It is naive to assume that the coming of
            women into equal power in society generally and in the church in particular will simply
            mean uncritical acceptance of values formerly given priority by men. Rather, I suggest
            that it will be a catalyst for transformation of our culture. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"><power_system p_patriarchy="artificial patriarchy">The roles and structures of
                patriarchy have been developed and sustained in accordance with an artificial
                polarization of human qualities into the traditional sexual
                stereotypes.</power_system> <identity gender="masculine stereotype">The image of the person in authority and the accepted
                    understanding of "his" role have corresponded to the eternal masculine stereotype, which
                    implies hyper- rationality, "objectivity," aggressivity, the possession of dominating
                    and manipulative attitudes toward persons and environment and the tendency to construct
                    boundaries between the self (and those identified with the self) and "the other."</identity> The
            caricature of a human being which is represented by this stereotype depends for its
            existence upon the opposite caricature —<identity gender="feminine stereotype">the eternal feminine (hyper-emotional, passive,
                self-abasing, etc.).</identity> <f_theory f_rad_fem="becoming whole persons">By becoming whole persons women can generate a counterforce to the
                    stereotype of the leader as they challenge the artificial polarization of human
                    characteristics.</f_theory> There is no reason to assume that women who have the support of their
            sisters to criticize the masculine stereotype will simply adopt it as a model for
            themselves. More likely they will develop a wider range of qualities and skills in
            themselves and thereby encourage men to engage in a comparably liberating procedure (a
            phenomenon we are beginning to witness already in men's liberation groups). This
            becoming of whole human beings will affect the values of our society, for it will
            involve a change in the fabric of human consciousness. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">Accordingly, it is reasonable to anticipate that this change will
            affect the symbols which reflect the values of our society, including religious symbols.
            <religion r_christianity="religious symbols as oppression">Since some of these have functioned to justify oppression, women and men would do well
                to welcome this change. Religious symbols die when the cultural situation that supported
                them ceases to give them plausibility.</religion> This should pose no problem to authentic faith,
            which accepts the relativity of all symbols and recognizes that fixation upon any of
            them as absolute in itself is idolatrous. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">The becoming of new symbols is not a matter that can arbitrarily be
            decided around a conference table. Rather, they grow out of a changing communal
            situation and experience. This does not mean that theologically we are consigned to the
            role of passive spectators.<f_theory f_rad_fem="consciousness evolution">We are called upon to be attentive to what the new
                experience of the becoming of women is revealing to us, and to foster the evolution of
                consciousness beyond the oppressiveness and imbalance reflected and justified by symbols
                and doctrines throughout the millennia of patriarchy.</f_theory></structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">This imbalance is apparent first of all in the biblical and popular
            image of trie great patriarch in heaven who rewards and punishes according to his
            mysterious and arbitrary will. <religion r_christianity="cruelty of christians, god as patriarch in heaven">The fact that the effects of this image have not always
                been humanizing is evident to any perceptive reader of history. The often cruel behavior
                of Christians toward unbelievers and even toward dissenters among themselves is shocking
                evidence of the function of that image in relation to values and behavior.</religion> </structure>
        
        <structure p="paragraph">Sophisticated thinkers, of course, have never intellectually
            identified God with an elderly parent in heaven. Nevertheless it is important to
            recognize that even when very abstract conceptualizations of God arc formulated in the
            mind, images have a way of surviving in the imagination in such a way that a person can
            function on two different and even apparently contradictory levels at the same time.
            <religion r_christianity="God as male">Thus one can speak of God as spirit and at the same time imagine "him" as belonging to
                the male sex.</religion> Such primitive images can profoundly affect conceptualizations which
            appear to be very refined and abstract. Even the Yahweh of the future, so cherished by
            the theology of hope, comes through on an imaginative level as exclusively a He-God, and
            it is perhaps consistent with this that theologians of hope have attempted to develop a
            political theology which takes no explicit cognizance of the devastation wrought by
            sexual politics. <power_system p_religion="Supreme Being as divine patriarch">The widespread conception of the "Supreme Being" as an entity distinct
                from this world but controlling it according to plan and keeping human beings in a state
                of infantile subjection has been a not too subtle mask of the divine patriarch. </power_system> The
            Supreme Being's plausibility, and that of the static worldview which accompanies this
            projection has, of course, declined. This was a projection grounded in specifically
            patriarchal infrastructures and sustained as subjectively real by the usual processes of
            generating plausibility. The sustaining power of the social infrastructures has been
            eroded by a number of developments in recent history, including the general trend toward
            democratization of society and the emergence of technology with the accompanying sense
            of mastery over' the world and man's destiny. <f_theory f_rad_fem="women's movement and theism">However, it is the women's movement which
                appears destined to play the key-role in the overthrow of such oppressive elements in
                traditional theism, precisely because it strikes at the source of the imbalance
                reflected in traditional beliefs.</f_theory> The women's movement will present a growing threat to
            patriarchal religion less by attacking it than by simply leaving it behind. Few of the
            leaders in the movement evince an interest in institutional religion, having recognized
            it as an instrument of their betrayal. Those who see their commitment to the movement as
            consonant with concern for the religious heritage are aware that the Christian tradition
            is by no means bereft of elements which foster genuine experiences and intimations of
            transcendence. The problem is that their liberating potential is choked off in the
            surrounding atmosphere of the images, ideas, values, and structures of patriarchy. What
            will, I think, become possible through the social change coming from radical feminism is
            a more acute and widespread perception of qualitative differences between those
            conceptualizations of God and of the human relationship to God which are oppressive in
            their implications, and those which encourage self-actualization and social commitment. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"> <s_theory s_enlightenment_individualism="hypostatized transcendence">The various theologies that hypostatize transcendence invariably
                use this "God" to legitimate oppression, particularly that of women. These are
                irredeemably anti- feminine and therefore anti-human.</s_theory> In contrast to this, a more
            authentic language of transcendence does not hypostatize or objectify God and
            consequently does not lend itself to such use. So for example, Tillich's way of speaking
            about God as ground and power of being would be very difficult to use for the
            legitimation of any sort of oppression. It grows out of awareness of that reality which
            is both transcendent and immanent, not reducible to or adequately represented by such
            expressions as person, father, supreme being. Awareness of this reality is not achieved
            by playing theological games but by existential courage. I am not saying that a
            liberated consciousness necessarily will use Tillich's language of transcendence. That
            of Whitehead, James, Jaspers, to mention a few—or an entirely new language—may do as
            well or better. But it remains true that the driving revelatory force which will make
            possible an authenticity of religious consciousness is courage in the face of anxiety. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"><f_theory f_rad_fem="deliverance from patriarchy">Since the projections of patriarchal religion have been blocking
                the dynamics of existential courage by otlering the false security of alienation—that
                is, of self-reduction to stereotyped roles—there is reason to see hope for the emergence
                of genuine religious consciousness in the massive challenge to patriarchy which is now
                in its initial stages. The becoming of women may be not only the doorway to deliverance
                from the omnipotent Father in all of his disguises—a deliverance which secular humanism
                has passionately fought for—but also a doorway to something, that is, the beginning for
                many of a more authentic search for transcendence, that is, for God.</f_theory></structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"> The imbalance in Christian ideology resulting from sexual
            hierarchy is manifested not only in the doctrine of God but also in the notion of Jesus
            as the unique God-man. <religion r_christianity="docetic christianity, Jesus as human">A great deal of Christian doctrine concerning Jesus has been
                docetic, that is, it has not really seriously accepted the fact that Jesus was a human
                being. </religion> An effect of the liberation of women will very likely be the loss of plausibility
            of Christological formulas which come close to reflecting a kind of idolatry in regard
            to the person of Jesus. As it becomes better understood that God is transcendent and
            unobjcctifiable—or else not at all— it will become less plausible to speak of Jesus as
            the Second Person of the Trinity who "assumed" a human nature. <power_system p_religion="Jesus as male supremacy">Indeed, the prevalent
                emphasis upon the total uniqueness and supereminence of Jesus will, I think, become less
                meaningful. To say this is not at all to deny his extraordinary character and mission.
                The point is to attempt a realistic assessment of certain ways of using his image (which
                in all likelihood he himself would repudiate). It is still not uncommon for priests and
                ministers, when confronted with the issue of women's liberation, to assert that God
                become incarnate uniquely as a male, and then to draw arguments for male supremacy from
                this. Indeed, the tradition itself tends to justify such assertions. The underlying—and
                often explicit—assumption in the minds of theologians down through the centuries has
                been that the divinity could not have deigned to become incarnate in the "inferior" sex,
                and the "fact" that "he" did not do so reinforces the belief in masculine superiority. </power_system>
            The transformation of society by the erosion of male dominance will generate serious
            challenges to such assumptions of the Christological tradition. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"><religion r_christianity="masculine incarnation symbolism">It will, I think, become increasingly evident that exclusively
                masculine symbols for the ideal of "incarnation" will not do. As a uniquely masculine
                divinity loses credibility, so also the idea of a unique divine incarnation in a human
                being of the male sex may give way in the religious consciousness to an increased
                awareness of the divine presence in all human beings, understood as expressing and in a
                real sense incarnating—although always inadequately—the power of being.</religion> The seeds of
            this awareness are already present, of course, in the traditional doctrine that all
            human beings are made to the image of God and in a less than adequate way in the
            doctrine of grace. Now it should become possible to work out with increasing realism the
            implication in both of these doctrines that human beings are called to
            self-actualization and to the creation of a community that fosters the becoming of women
            and men. This means that no completely adequate models can be taken from the past. It
            may be that we will witness a re- mythologizing of Western religion. Certainly, if the
            need for parental symbols for God persists, something like the Father-Mother God
            proposed by Mary Baker Eddy will be more acceptable to the new woman and the new man
            than the Father God of the past. A symbolism for incarnation of the divine in human
            beings may continue to be needed in the future, but it is highly unlikely that women or
            men will continue to find plausible that symbolism which is epitomized in the image of
            the Virgin kneeling in adoration before her own son. <religion r_christianity="bisexual imagery">Perhaps this will be replaced by
                the emergence of bisexual imagery which is not hierarchical. The experience of the
                past brought forth a new Adam and a new Eve. Perhaps the future will bring a new Christ
                and a new Mary. </religion> For the present, it would appear that we arc being called upon to
            recognize the poverty of all symbols and the fact of our past idolatry regarding them,
            and to turn to our own resources for bringing about the radically new in our own lives. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"><religion r_christianity="Jesus and women's liberation">The manifestation of God in Jesus was an eschato- logical event
                whose fulfilled reality lies in the future. The Jesus of the Gospels was a free person
                who challenged ossified beliefs and laws. Since he was remarkably free of prejudice
                against women and treated them as equals insofar as the limitations of his culture
                'would allow, it is certain that he would be working with them for their liberation
                today. This awakening of women to their human potentiality by creative action as they
                assume equal partnership with men in society can bring about a manifestation of God in
                themselves which will be the Second Coming of God incarnate, fulfilling the latent
                promise in the original revelation that men and women are made to the image of God.</religion> </structure>
        <structure subhead="subheading">Behind the Mask </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph">It should be evident, then, that women's liberation is an event
            that can challenge authoritarian, exclusive and non-existential notions of faith and
            revelation. <f_theory f_rad_fem="women as extra-environmentals">Since women have been extra-environmentals, to use a McLuhanish term, that
                is, since they have not been part of the authority structure which uses "faith" and
                "revelation" to reinforce the mechanisms of alienation, their emergence can effect a
                more widespread critical- ness of idolatry which is often masked by these ideas.</f_theory> There
            could result from this a more general understanding of faith as a state of ultimate
            concern and commitment and a heightened sense of relativity concerning the symbols it
            uses to express this commitment. An awareness might also emerge—not merely in the minds
            of a theological elite, but in the general con sciousness—that revelation is an ongoing
            experience. </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"><religion r_christianity="challenge old order and change morals">The becoming of women implies also a transvaluation of values in
                Christian morality. As the old order is challenged and as men and women become freed to
                experience a wholeness of personality which the old polarizations impeded, the
                potentiality will be awakened for a change in moral consciousness which will go far
                beyond Nietzsche's merely reactionary rejection of Christian values. </religion> </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"> <religion r_christianity="passive virtues">Much of the traditional theory of Christian virtue appears to be
                the product of reactions on the part of men —perhaps guilty reactions—to the behavioral
                excesses of the stereotypic male. There has been theoretical emphasis upon charity,
                meekness, obedience, humility, self- abnegation, sacrifice, service. Part of the problem
                with this moral ideology is that it became generally accepted not by men but by women,
                who have hardly been helped by an ethic which reinforced their abject situation.</religion> This
            emphasis upon the passive virtues, of course, has not challenged exploitativeness but
            supported it. Part of the syndrome is the prevailing notion of sin as an offense against
            those in power, or against "God" (the two are often equated). Within the perspective of
            such a privatized morality the structures themselves of oppression arc not seen as
            sinful.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"><religion r_christianity="reproductive morality">Consistent with all of this is the fact that the traditional
                Christian moral consciousness has been fixated upon the problems of reproductive
                activity in a manner totally disproportionate to its feeble political concern. This was
                summed up several years ago in Archbishop Roberts' remark that "if contraceptives had
                been dropped over Japan instead of bombs which merely killed, maimed and shriveled up
                thousands alive there would have been a squeal of outraged protest from the Vatican to
                the remotest Mass center in Asia." Pertinent also is Simone de Beauvoir's remark that
                the church has reserved its uncompromising humanitarian- ism for man in the fetal
                condition.</religion> Although theologians today acknowledge that this privatized morality has
            failed to cope with the structures of oppression, few seriously face the possibility
            that the roots of this distortion are deeply buried in the fundamental and all-
            pervasive sexual alienation which the women's movement is seeking to
            overcome.</structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"> <power_system p_religion="projection of the other">It is well-known that Christians under the spell of the jealous
                God who represents the coliective power of his chosen people can use religion to justify
                that "us and them" attitude which is disastrous in its consequences for the powerless.</power_system>
            <power_system p_patriarchy="sexism as root of all bigotry">> It is less widely understood that the projection of "the other"—easily adaptable to
                national, racial and class differences—has basically and primordially been directed
                against women. Even the rhetoric of racism finds its model in sexism.</power_system></structure>
        
        <structure p="paragraph"> <f_theory f_rad_fem="saving humanity from destruction">The consciousness-raising which is beginning among women is
                evoking a qualitatively new understanding of the subtle mechanisms which produce and
                destroy "the other," and a consequent empathy with all of the oppressed. This gives
                grounds for the hope that their emergence can generate a counterforce to the
                exploitative mentality which is destroying persons and the environment. Since the way
                men and women are seen in society is a prime determinant in the whole social system and
                ideology, radical women refuse to see their movement as simply one among others. What I
                am suggesting is that it might be the only chance for the turning of human beings from a
                course leading to the deterioration and perhaps the end of life on this
                planet. </f_theory> </structure>
        <structure p="paragraph"> Those who see their concern for women's liberation as consonant
            with an evolving Christianity would be unrealistic to expect much comprehension from the
            majority of male ecclesiastics. Such writers as Gordon Rattrey Taylor (The Biological
            Time Bomb), Robert Francoeur (Utopian Motherhood), and others ke«p beeping out the
            message that we are moving into a world in which human sexuality is no longer merely
            oriented to reproduction of the species—which means that the masculine and feminine
            mystiques are doomed to evaporate. Within the theological community, however, the
            predictable and almost universal response has been what one might call the ostrich
            syndrome. Whereas the old theology justified sexual oppression, the new theology for the
            most part simply ignores it and goes on in comfortable compatibility with it, failing to
            recognize its deep connection with such other major problems as war, racism and
            environmental pollution. The work of fostering religious consciousness which is
            explicitly incompatible with sexism will require an extraordinary degree of creative
            rage, love and hope.</structure>

            someone else wrote, just in different words—sometimes in the same words [laughs]. There’s no real con¬ text or basis for many of these
