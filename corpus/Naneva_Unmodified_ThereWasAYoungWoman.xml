    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SWALLOWED A LIE, 
    We all know why she swallowed that lie, 
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN
    WHO SWALLOWED A RULE, 
    "Live to serve others", 
    she learned it in school.
    SHe swalloed the rule
    to go with the lie, 
    We all know why she
    swallowed that lie,
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN
    WHO SWALLOWED SOME FLUFF;
    Lipstick &amp; candy &amp; powder
    &amp; puff --
    She swallowed the FLUFF
    to sweeten the rule, 
    She swallowed the rule
    to go with the lie,
    We all know why
    she swallowed that lie,
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN
    WHO SWALLOWED A LINE, 
    "I like 'em dumb baby,
    you suit me fine."
    She swallowed the line
    to go with the FLUFF
    She swallowed the FLUFF
    to sweeten the rule, 
    She swallowed the rule
    to go with the lie,
    We all know why
    she swallowed that lie,
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SWALLOWED A PILL,
    Might have said, "No," but she hadn't the will.
    She swallowed the pill to go with the line,
    She swallowed the line
    to go with the FLUFF
    She swallowed the FLUFF
    to sweeten the rule, 
    She swallowed the rule
    to go with the lie,
    We all know why
    she swallowed that lie,
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SWALLOWED A RING,
    Looked like a princess but felt like a thing.
    She swallowed the ring
    to make up for the pill,
    She swallowed the pill to go with the line,
    She swallowed the line
    to go with the FLUFF
    She swallowed the FLUFF
    to sweeten the rule, 
    She swallowed the rule
    to go with the lie,
    We all know why
    she swallowed that lie...
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    THERE WAS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO SWALLOWED SOME SPOCK,
    "Stay at home, Mother, take care of your flock."
    She swalloed the Spock to go with the ring, 
    She swallowed the ring
    to make up for the pill,
    She swallowed the pill to go with the line,
    She swallowed the line
    to go with the FLUFF
    She swallowed the FLUFF
    to sweeten the rule, 
    She swallowed the rule
    to go with the lie,
    We all know why
    she swallowed that lie
    PERHAPS SHE'LL DIE!
    
    ONE DAY THIS YOUNG WOMAN WOKE UP &amp; SHE SAID,
    "I've swallowed so much, I wish I were dead.
    I swallowed it all to go with the Spock,
    I swallowed the Spock to go with the ring, 
    I swallowed the ring to make up for the pill,
    I swallowed the pill to go with the line,
    I swallowed the line to go with the FLUFF,
    I swallowed the FLUFF to sweeten the rule,
    I swallowed the rule to go with the lie,
    Why in the world did I swallow that lie!?
    PERHAPS I'LL DIE!"
    
    SHE RAN TO HER SISTERS, IT WASN'T TOO LATE
    TO BE LIBERATED, REGURGITATE.
    She threw up the Spock &amp; threw up the ring, 
    Looked like a princess, but felt like a thing;
    She threw up the pill &amp; threw up the line,
    "I like 'em dumb, baby, you suit me fine;
    She threw up the FLUFF and threw up the rule,
    "Live to serve others," she learned it in school;
    And last but not least, she threw up that lie, -
    We all know why she threw up that lie,
    SHE WILL NOT DIE!!
