1. Removed matter to include just the text at hand both in the front and in the back.
2. Reserved characters 
conducted the procedure replacements to avoid errors later on, still having trouble with this part though. Need to put it in more practice.
& --> &amp; 
< --> &lt; 
> --> &gt;
3. Extra blank lines 
FIND: \n{3,}
REPLACE: \n\n
4. Paragraphs 
FIND: \n\n
REPLACE: </p>\n<p>
5. Chapters 
(used the assistance of university-provided AI for this particular part, ran into some barriers).
FIND: ^<p>([IVX]+\. .+)</p>$                   (???????)
REPLACE: <title>\1</title>
6. Chapters (continued)
FIND: <title>([IVX]+\. .+)</title>             (????????)
REPLACE:<chapter> </chapter> <title>\1</title>
7. QUOTES 
This is where "Dot matches all" needs to be checked off. 
FIND:"(.+?)"
REPLACE: <quote>\1</quote>
8. CLEANUP
<title>The Blithedale Romance</title>
<author>Nathaniel Hawthorne</author>

Also added the root element <book> to tie the document together. :)


! Still have a ways to go to be fluid in this process, but putting in the time to make this work is really helping.
